      "Emma Woodhouse, handsome, clever, and rich, with a comfortable home\n",
      "and happy disposition, seemed to unite some of the best blessings of\n",
      "existence; and had lived nearly twenty-one years in the world with very\n",
      "little to distress or vex her.\n",
      "\n",
      "She was the youngest of the two daughters of a most affectionate,\n",
      "indulgent father; and had, in consequence of her sister's marriage, been\n",
      "mistress of his house from a very early period. Her mother had died\n",
      "too long ago for her to have more than an indistinct remembrance of\n",
      "her caresses; and her place had been supplied by an excellent woman as\n",
      "governess, who had fallen little short of a mother in affection.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sixteen years had Miss Taylor been in Mr. Woodhouse's family, less as a\n",
      "governess than a friend, very fond of both daughters, but particularly\n",
      "of Emma. Between _them_ it was more the intimacy of sisters. Even before\n",
      "Miss Taylor had ceased to hold the nominal office of governess, the\n",
      "mildness of her temper had hardly allowed her to impose any restraint;\n",
      "and the shadow of authority being now long passed away, they had been\n",
      "living together as friend and friend very mutually attached, and Emma\n",
      "doing just what she liked; highly esteeming Miss Taylor's judgment, but\n",
      "directed chiefly by her own.\n",
      "\n",
      "The real evils, indeed, of Emma's situation were the power of having\n",
      "rather too much her own way, and a disposition to think a little too\n",
      "well of herself; these were the disadvantages which threatened alloy to\n",
      "her many enjoyments. The danger, however, was at present so unperceived,\n",
      "that they did not by any means rank as misfortunes with her.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sorrow came--a gentle sorrow--but not at all in the shape of any\n",
      "disagreeable consciousness.--Miss Taylor married. It was Miss Taylor's\n",
      "loss which first brought grief. It was on the wedding-day of this\n",
      "beloved friend that Emma first sat in mournful thought of any\n",
      "continuance. The wedding over, and the bride-people gone, her father and\n",
      "herself were left to dine together, with no prospect of a third to cheer\n",
      "a long evening. Her father composed himself to sleep after dinner, as\n",
      "usual, and she had then only to sit and think of what she had lost.\n",
      "\n",
      "The event had every promise of happiness for her friend. Mr. Weston\n",
      "was a man of unexceptionable character, easy fortune, suitable age, and\n",
      "pleasant manners; and there was some satisfaction in considering\n",
      "with what self-denying, generous friendship she had always wished and\n",
      "promoted the match; but it was a black morning's work for her. The want\n",
      "of Miss Taylor would be felt every hour of every day. She recalled her\n",
      "past kindness--the kindness, the affection of sixteen years--how she had\n",
      "taught and how she had played with her from five years old--how she had\n",
      "devoted all her powers to attach and amuse her in health--and how\n",
      "nursed her through the various illnesses of childhood. A large debt of\n",
      "gratitude was owing here; but the intercourse of the last seven\n",
      "years, the equal footing and perfect unreserve which had soon followed\n",
      "Isabella's marriage, on their being left to each other, was yet a\n",
      "dearer, tenderer recollection. She had been a friend and companion such\n",
      "as few possessed: intelligent, well-informed, useful, gentle, knowing\n",
      "all the ways of the family, interested in all its concerns, and\n",
      "peculiarly interested in herself, in every pleasure, every scheme of\n",
      "hers--one to whom she could speak every thought as it arose, and who had\n",
      "such an affection for her as could never find fault.\n",
      "\n",
      "How was she to bear the change?--It was true that her friend was going\n",
      "only half a mile from them; but Emma was aware that great must be the\n",
      "difference between a Mrs. Weston, only half a mile from them, and a Miss\n",
      "Taylor in the house; and with all her advantages, natural and domestic,\n",
      "she was now in great danger of suffering from intellectual solitude. She\n",
      "dearly loved her father, but he was no companion for her. He could not\n",
      "meet her in conversation, rational or playful.\n",
      "\n",
      "The evil of the actual disparity in their ages (and Mr. Woodhouse had\n",
      "not married early) was much increased by his constitution and habits;\n",
      "for having been a valetudinarian all his life, without activity of\n",
      "mind or body, he was a much older man in ways than in years; and though\n",
      "everywhere beloved for the friendliness of his heart and his amiable\n",
      "temper, his talents could not have recommended him at any time.\n",
      "\n",
      "Her sister, though comparatively but little removed by matrimony, being\n",
      "settled in London, only sixteen miles off, was much beyond her daily\n",
      "reach; and many a long October and November evening must be struggled\n",
      "through at Hartfield, before Christmas brought the next visit from\n",
      "Isabella and her husband, and their little children, to fill the house,\n",
      "and give her pleasant society again.\n",
      "\n",
      "Highbury, the large and populous village, almost amounting to a town,\n",
      "to which Hartfield, in spite of its separate lawn, and shrubberies, and\n",
      "name, did really belong, afforded her no equals. The Woodhouses\n",
      "were first in consequence there. All looked up to them. She had many\n",
      "acquaintance in the place, for her father was universally civil, but\n",
      "not one among them who could be accepted in lieu of Miss Taylor for even\n",
      "half a day. It was a melancholy change; and Emma could not but sigh over\n",
      "it, and wish for impossible things, till her father awoke, and made it\n",
      "necessary to be cheerful. His spirits required support. He was a nervous\n",
      "man, easily depressed; fond of every body that he was used to, and\n",
      "hating to part with them; hating change of every kind. Matrimony, as the\n",
      "origin of change, was always disagreeable; and he was by no means yet\n",
      "reconciled to his own daughter's marrying, nor could ever speak of her\n",
      "but with compassion, though it had been entirely a match of affection,\n",
      "when he was now obliged to part with Miss Taylor too; and from his\n",
      "habits of gentle selfishness, and of being never able to suppose that\n",
      "other people could feel differently from himself, he was very much\n",
      "disposed to think Miss Taylor had done as sad a thing for herself as for\n",
      "them, and would have been a great deal happier if she had spent all the\n",
      "rest of her life at Hartfield. Emma smiled and chatted as cheerfully\n",
      "as she could, to keep him from such thoughts; but when tea came, it was\n",
      "impossible for him not to say exactly as he had said at dinner,\n",
      "\n",
      "“Poor Miss Taylor!--I wish she were here again. What a pity it is that\n",
      "Mr. Weston ever thought of her!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I cannot agree with you, papa; you know I cannot. Mr. Weston is such\n",
      "a good-humoured, pleasant, excellent man, that he thoroughly deserves\n",
      "a good wife;--and you would not have had Miss Taylor live with us for\n",
      "ever, and bear all my odd humours, when she might have a house of her\n",
      "own?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“A house of her own!--But where is the advantage of a house of her own?\n",
      "This is three times as large.--And you have never any odd humours, my\n",
      "dear.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“How often we shall be going to see them, and they coming to see us!--We\n",
      "shall be always meeting! _We_ must begin; we must go and pay wedding\n",
      "visit very soon.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“My dear, how am I to get so far? Randalls is such a distance. I could\n",
      "not walk half so far.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No, papa, nobody thought of your walking. We must go in the carriage,\n",
      "to be sure.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“The carriage! But James will not like to put the horses to for such a\n",
      "little way;--and where are the poor horses to be while we are paying our\n",
      "visit?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“They are to be put into Mr. Weston's stable, papa. You know we have\n",
      "settled all that already. We talked it all over with Mr. Weston last\n",
      "night. And as for James, you may be very sure he will always like going\n",
      "to Randalls, because of his daughter's being housemaid there. I only\n",
      "doubt whether he will ever take us anywhere else. That was your doing,\n",
      "papa. You got Hannah that good place. Nobody thought of Hannah till you\n",
      "mentioned her--James is so obliged to you!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I am very glad I did think of her. It was very lucky, for I would not\n",
      "have had poor James think himself slighted upon any account; and I am\n",
      "sure she will make a very good servant: she is a civil, pretty-spoken\n",
      "girl; I have a great opinion of her. Whenever I see her, she always\n",
      "curtseys and asks me how I do, in a very pretty manner; and when you\n",
      "have had her here to do needlework, I observe she always turns the lock\n",
      "of the door the right way and never bangs it. I am sure she will be an\n",
      "excellent servant; and it will be a great comfort to poor Miss Taylor\n",
      "to have somebody about her that she is used to see. Whenever James goes\n",
      "over to see his daughter, you know, she will be hearing of us. He will\n",
      "be able to tell her how we all are.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Emma spared no exertions to maintain this happier flow of ideas, and\n",
      "hoped, by the help of backgammon, to get her father tolerably\n",
      "through the evening, and be attacked by no regrets but her own. The\n",
      "backgammon-table was placed; but a visitor immediately afterwards walked\n",
      "in and made it unnecessary.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Knightley, a sensible man about seven or eight-and-thirty, was not\n",
      "only a very old and intimate friend of the family, but particularly\n",
      "connected with it, as the elder brother of Isabella's husband. He lived\n",
      "about a mile from Highbury, was a frequent visitor, and always welcome,\n",
      "and at this time more welcome than usual, as coming directly from their\n",
      "mutual connexions in London. He had returned to a late dinner, after\n",
      "some days' absence, and now walked up to Hartfield to say that all were\n",
      "well in Brunswick Square. It was a happy circumstance, and animated\n",
      "Mr. Woodhouse for some time. Mr. Knightley had a cheerful manner, which\n",
      "always did him good; and his many inquiries after “poor Isabella” and\n",
      "her children were answered most satisfactorily. When this was over, Mr.\n",
      "Woodhouse gratefully observed, “It is very kind of you, Mr. Knightley,\n",
      "to come out at this late hour to call upon us. I am afraid you must have\n",
      "had a shocking walk.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Not at all, sir. It is a beautiful moonlight night; and so mild that I\n",
      "must draw back from your great fire.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But you must have found it very damp and dirty. I wish you may not\n",
      "catch cold.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Dirty, sir! Look at my shoes. Not a speck on them.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well! that is quite surprising, for we have had a vast deal of rain\n",
      "here. It rained dreadfully hard for half an hour while we were at\n",
      "breakfast. I wanted them to put off the wedding.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“By the bye--I have not wished you joy. Being pretty well aware of what\n",
      "sort of joy you must both be feeling, I have been in no hurry with my\n",
      "congratulations; but I hope it all went off tolerably well. How did you\n",
      "all behave? Who cried most?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ah! poor Miss Taylor! 'Tis a sad business.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Poor Mr. and Miss Woodhouse, if you please; but I cannot possibly say\n",
      "'poor Miss Taylor.' I have a great regard for you and Emma; but when it\n",
      "comes to the question of dependence or independence!--At any rate, it\n",
      "must be better to have only one to please than two.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Especially when _one_ of those two is such a fanciful, troublesome\n",
      "creature!” said Emma playfully. “That is what you have in your head, I\n",
      "know--and what you would certainly say if my father were not by.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I believe it is very true, my dear, indeed,” said Mr. Woodhouse, with a\n",
      "sigh. “I am afraid I am sometimes very fanciful and troublesome.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“My dearest papa! You do not think I could mean _you_, or suppose Mr.\n",
      "Knightley to mean _you_. What a horrible idea! Oh no! I meant only\n",
      "myself. Mr. Knightley loves to find fault with me, you know--in a\n",
      "joke--it is all a joke. We always say what we like to one another.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Knightley, in fact, was one of the few people who could see faults\n",
      "in Emma Woodhouse, and the only one who ever told her of them: and\n",
      "though this was not particularly agreeable to Emma herself, she knew\n",
      "it would be so much less so to her father, that she would not have him\n",
      "really suspect such a circumstance as her not being thought perfect by\n",
      "every body.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Emma knows I never flatter her,” said Mr. Knightley, “but I meant no\n",
      "reflection on any body. Miss Taylor has been used to have two persons\n",
      "to please; she will now have but one. The chances are that she must be a\n",
      "gainer.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well,” said Emma, willing to let it pass--“you want to hear about\n",
      "the wedding; and I shall be happy to tell you, for we all behaved\n",
      "charmingly. Every body was punctual, every body in their best looks: not\n",
      "a tear, and hardly a long face to be seen. Oh no; we all felt that we\n",
      "were going to be only half a mile apart, and were sure of meeting every\n",
      "day.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Dear Emma bears every thing so well,” said her father. “But, Mr.\n",
      "Knightley, she is really very sorry to lose poor Miss Taylor, and I am\n",
      "sure she _will_ miss her more than she thinks for.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Emma turned away her head, divided between tears and smiles. “It\n",
      "is impossible that Emma should not miss such a companion,” said Mr.\n",
      "Knightley. “We should not like her so well as we do, sir, if we could\n",
      "suppose it; but she knows how much the marriage is to Miss Taylor's\n",
      "advantage; she knows how very acceptable it must be, at Miss Taylor's\n",
      "time of life, to be settled in a home of her own, and how important to\n",
      "her to be secure of a comfortable provision, and therefore cannot allow\n",
      "herself to feel so much pain as pleasure. Every friend of Miss Taylor\n",
      "must be glad to have her so happily married.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“And you have forgotten one matter of joy to me,” said Emma, “and a very\n",
      "considerable one--that I made the match myself. I made the match, you\n",
      "know, four years ago; and to have it take place, and be proved in the\n",
      "right, when so many people said Mr. Weston would never marry again, may\n",
      "comfort me for any thing.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Knightley shook his head at her. Her father fondly replied, “Ah!\n",
      "my dear, I wish you would not make matches and foretell things, for\n",
      "whatever you say always comes to pass. Pray do not make any more\n",
      "matches.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I promise you to make none for myself, papa; but I must, indeed, for\n",
      "other people. It is the greatest amusement in the world! And after such\n",
      "success, you know!--Every body said that Mr. Weston would never marry\n",
      "again. Oh dear, no! Mr. Weston, who had been a widower so long, and who\n",
      "seemed so perfectly comfortable without a wife, so constantly occupied\n",
      "either in his business in town or among his friends here, always\n",
      "acceptable wherever he went, always cheerful--Mr. Weston need not spend\n",
      "a single evening in the year alone if he did not like it. Oh no! Mr.\n",
      "Weston certainly would never marry again. Some people even talked of a\n",
      "promise to his wife on her deathbed, and others of the son and the\n",
      "uncle not letting him. All manner of solemn nonsense was talked on the\n",
      "subject, but I believed none of it.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ever since the day--about four years ago--that Miss Taylor and I met\n",
      "with him in Broadway Lane, when, because it began to drizzle, he darted\n",
      "away with so much gallantry, and borrowed two umbrellas for us from\n",
      "Farmer Mitchell's, I made up my mind on the subject. I planned the match\n",
      "from that hour; and when such success has blessed me in this instance,\n",
      "dear papa, you cannot think that I shall leave off match-making.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I do not understand what you mean by 'success,'” said Mr. Knightley.\n",
      "“Success supposes endeavour. Your time has been properly and delicately\n",
      "spent, if you have been endeavouring for the last four years to bring\n",
      "about this marriage. A worthy employment for a young lady's mind! But\n",
      "if, which I rather imagine, your making the match, as you call it, means\n",
      "only your planning it, your saying to yourself one idle day, 'I think it\n",
      "would be a very good thing for Miss Taylor if Mr. Weston were to marry\n",
      "her,' and saying it again to yourself every now and then afterwards, why\n",
      "do you talk of success? Where is your merit? What are you proud of? You\n",
      "made a lucky guess; and _that_ is all that can be said.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“And have you never known the pleasure and triumph of a lucky guess?--I\n",
      "pity you.--I thought you cleverer--for, depend upon it a lucky guess is\n",
      "never merely luck. There is always some talent in it. And as to my\n",
      "poor word 'success,' which you quarrel with, I do not know that I am so\n",
      "entirely without any claim to it. You have drawn two pretty pictures;\n",
      "but I think there may be a third--a something between the do-nothing and\n",
      "the do-all. If I had not promoted Mr. Weston's visits here, and given\n",
      "many little encouragements, and smoothed many little matters, it might\n",
      "not have come to any thing after all. I think you must know Hartfield\n",
      "enough to comprehend that.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“A straightforward, open-hearted man like Weston, and a rational,\n",
      "unaffected woman like Miss Taylor, may be safely left to manage their\n",
      "own concerns. You are more likely to have done harm to yourself, than\n",
      "good to them, by interference.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Emma never thinks of herself, if she can do good to others,” rejoined\n",
      "Mr. Woodhouse, understanding but in part. “But, my dear, pray do not\n",
      "make any more matches; they are silly things, and break up one's family\n",
      "circle grievously.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Only one more, papa; only for Mr. Elton. Poor Mr. Elton! You like Mr.\n",
      "Elton, papa,--I must look about for a wife for him. There is nobody in\n",
      "Highbury who deserves him--and he has been here a whole year, and has\n",
      "fitted up his house so comfortably, that it would be a shame to have him\n",
      "single any longer--and I thought when he was joining their hands to-day,\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Weston was a native of Highbury, and born of a respectable family,\n",
      "which for the last two or three generations had been rising into\n",
      "gentility and property. He had received a good education, but, on\n",
      "succeeding early in life to a small independence, had become indisposed\n",
      "for any of the more homely pursuits in which his brothers were engaged,\n",
      "and had satisfied an active, cheerful mind and social temper by entering\n",
      "into the militia of his county, then embodied.\n",
      "\n",
      "Captain Weston was a general favourite; and when the chances of his\n",
      "military life had introduced him to Miss Churchill, of a great Yorkshire\n",
      "family, and Miss Churchill fell in love with him, nobody was surprized,\n",
      "except her brother and his wife, who had never seen him, and who were\n",
      "full of pride and importance, which the connexion would offend.\n",
      "\n",
      "Miss Churchill, however, being of age, and with the full command of her\n",
      "fortune--though her fortune bore no proportion to the family-estate--was\n",
      "not to be dissuaded from the marriage, and it took place, to the\n",
      "infinite mortification of Mr. and Mrs. Churchill, who threw her off with\n",
      "due decorum. It was an unsuitable connexion, and did not produce much\n",
      "happiness. Mrs. Weston ought to have found more in it, for she had a\n",
      "husband whose warm heart and sweet temper made him think every thing due\n",
      "to her in return for the great goodness of being in love with him;\n",
      "but though she had one sort of spirit, she had not the best. She had\n",
      "resolution enough to pursue her own will in spite of her brother,\n",
      "but not enough to refrain from unreasonable regrets at that brother's\n",
      "unreasonable anger, nor from missing the luxuries of her former home.\n",
      "They lived beyond their income, but still it was nothing in comparison\n",
      "of Enscombe: she did not cease to love her husband, but she wanted at\n",
      "once to be the wife of Captain Weston, and Miss Churchill of Enscombe.\n",
      "\n",
      "Captain Weston, who had been considered, especially by the Churchills,\n",
      "as making such an amazing match, was proved to have much the worst of\n",
      "the bargain; for when his wife died, after a three years' marriage, he\n",
      "was rather a poorer man than at first, and with a child to maintain.\n",
      "From the expense of the child, however, he was soon relieved. The boy\n",
      "had, with the additional softening claim of a lingering illness of his\n",
      "mother's, been the means of a sort of reconciliation; and Mr. and Mrs.\n",
      "Churchill, having no children of their own, nor any other young creature\n",
      "of equal kindred to care for, offered to take the whole charge of the\n",
      "little Frank soon after her decease. Some scruples and some reluctance\n",
      "the widower-father may be supposed to have felt; but as they were\n",
      "overcome by other considerations, the child was given up to the care and\n",
      "the wealth of the Churchills, and he had only his own comfort to seek,\n",
      "and his own situation to improve as he could.\n",
      "\n",
      "A complete change of life became desirable. He quitted the militia and\n",
      "engaged in trade, having brothers already established in a good way in\n",
      "London, which afforded him a favourable opening. It was a concern which\n",
      "brought just employment enough. He had still a small house in Highbury,\n",
      "where most of his leisure days were spent; and between useful occupation\n",
      "and the pleasures of society, the next eighteen or twenty years of his\n",
      "life passed cheerfully away. He had, by that time, realised an easy\n",
      "competence--enough to secure the purchase of a little estate adjoining\n",
      "Highbury, which he had always longed for--enough to marry a woman as\n",
      "portionless even as Miss Taylor, and to live according to the wishes of\n",
      "his own friendly and social disposition.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was now some time since Miss Taylor had begun to influence his\n",
      "schemes; but as it was not the tyrannic influence of youth on youth,\n",
      "it had not shaken his determination of never settling till he could\n",
      "purchase Randalls, and the sale of Randalls was long looked forward to;\n",
      "but he had gone steadily on, with these objects in view, till they were\n",
      "accomplished. He had made his fortune, bought his house, and obtained\n",
      "his wife; and was beginning a new period of existence, with every\n",
      "probability of greater happiness than in any yet passed through. He had\n",
      "never been an unhappy man; his own temper had secured him from that,\n",
      "even in his first marriage; but his second must shew him how delightful\n",
      "a well-judging and truly amiable woman could be, and must give him the\n",
      "pleasantest proof of its being a great deal better to choose than to be\n",
      "chosen, to excite gratitude than to feel it.\n",
      "\n",
      "He had only himself to please in his choice: his fortune was his own;\n",
      "for as to Frank, it was more than being tacitly brought up as his\n",
      "uncle's heir, it had become so avowed an adoption as to have him assume\n",
      "the name of Churchill on coming of age. It was most unlikely, therefore,\n",
      "that he should ever want his father's assistance. His father had no\n",
      "apprehension of it. The aunt was a capricious woman, and governed her\n",
      "husband entirely; but it was not in Mr. Weston's nature to imagine that\n",
      "any caprice could be strong enough to affect one so dear, and, as he\n",
      "believed, so deservedly dear. He saw his son every year in London, and\n",
      "was proud of him; and his fond report of him as a very fine young man\n",
      "had made Highbury feel a sort of pride in him too. He was looked on as\n",
      "sufficiently belonging to the place to make his merits and prospects a\n",
      "kind of common concern.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Frank Churchill was one of the boasts of Highbury, and a lively\n",
      "curiosity to see him prevailed, though the compliment was so little\n",
      "returned that he had never been there in his life. His coming to visit\n",
      "his father had been often talked of but never achieved.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, upon his father's marriage, it was very generally proposed, as a\n",
      "most proper attention, that the visit should take place. There was not a\n",
      "dissentient voice on the subject, either when Mrs. Perry drank tea with\n",
      "Mrs. and Miss Bates, or when Mrs. and Miss Bates returned the visit. Now\n",
      "was the time for Mr. Frank Churchill to come among them; and the hope\n",
      "strengthened when it was understood that he had written to his new\n",
      "mother on the occasion. For a few days, every morning visit in Highbury\n",
      "included some mention of the handsome letter Mrs. Weston had received.\n",
      "“I suppose you have heard of the handsome letter Mr. Frank Churchill\n",
      "has written to Mrs. Weston? I understand it was a very handsome letter,\n",
      "indeed. Mr. Woodhouse told me of it. Mr. Woodhouse saw the letter, and\n",
      "he says he never saw such a handsome letter in his life.”\n",
      "\n",
      "It was, indeed, a highly prized letter. Mrs. Weston had, of course,\n",
      "formed a very favourable idea of the young man; and such a pleasing\n",
      "attention was an irresistible proof of his great good sense, and a most\n",
      "welcome addition to every source and every expression of congratulation\n",
      "which her marriage had already secured. She felt herself a most\n",
      "fortunate woman; and she had lived long enough to know how fortunate\n",
      "she might well be thought, where the only regret was for a partial\n",
      "separation from friends whose friendship for her had never cooled, and\n",
      "who could ill bear to part with her.\n",
      "\n",
      "She knew that at times she must be missed; and could not think, without\n",
      "pain, of Emma's losing a single pleasure, or suffering an hour's ennui,\n",
      "from the want of her companionableness: but dear Emma was of no feeble\n",
      "character; she was more equal to her situation than most girls would\n",
      "have been, and had sense, and energy, and spirits that might be hoped\n",
      "would bear her well and happily through its little difficulties and\n",
      "privations. And then there was such comfort in the very easy distance of\n",
      "Randalls from Hartfield, so convenient for even solitary female walking,\n",
      "and in Mr. Weston's disposition and circumstances, which would make the\n",
      "approaching season no hindrance to their spending half the evenings in\n",
      "the week together.\n",
      "\n",
      "Her situation was altogether the subject of hours of gratitude to Mrs.\n",
      "Weston, and of moments only of regret; and her satisfaction--her more\n",
      "than satisfaction--her cheerful enjoyment, was so just and so apparent,\n",
      "that Emma, well as she knew her father, was sometimes taken by surprize\n",
      "at his being still able to pity 'poor Miss Taylor,' when they left her\n",
      "at Randalls in the centre of every domestic comfort, or saw her go away\n",
      "in the evening attended by her pleasant husband to a carriage of her\n",
      "own. But never did she go without Mr. Woodhouse's giving a gentle sigh,\n",
      "and saying, “Ah, poor Miss Taylor! She would be very glad to stay.”\n",
      "\n",
      "There was no recovering Miss Taylor--nor much likelihood of ceasing to\n",
      "pity her; but a few weeks brought some alleviation to Mr. Woodhouse.\n",
      "The compliments of his neighbours were over; he was no longer teased by\n",
      "being wished joy of so sorrowful an event; and the wedding-cake, which\n",
      "had been a great distress to him, was all eat up. His own stomach\n",
      "could bear nothing rich, and he could never believe other people to be\n",
      "different from himself. What was unwholesome to him he regarded as unfit\n",
      "for any body; and he had, therefore, earnestly tried to dissuade them\n",
      "from having any wedding-cake at all, and when that proved vain, as\n",
      "earnestly tried to prevent any body's eating it. He had been at the\n",
      "pains of consulting Mr. Perry, the apothecary, on the subject. Mr. Perry\n",
      "was an intelligent, gentlemanlike man, whose frequent visits were one\n",
      "of the comforts of Mr. Woodhouse's life; and upon being applied to, he\n",
      "could not but acknowledge (though it seemed rather against the bias\n",
      "of inclination) that wedding-cake might certainly disagree with\n",
      "many--perhaps with most people, unless taken moderately. With such an\n",
      "opinion, in confirmation of his own, Mr. Woodhouse hoped to influence\n",
      "every visitor of the newly married pair; but still the cake was eaten;\n",
      "and there was no rest for his benevolent nerves till it was all gone.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was a strange rumour in Highbury of all the little Perrys being\n",
      "seen with a slice of Mrs. Weston's wedding-cake in their hands: but Mr.\n",
      "Woodhouse would never believe it.\n",

      "CHAPTER III\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Woodhouse was fond of society in his own way. He liked very much to\n",
      "have his friends come and see him; and from various united causes, from\n",
      "his long residence at Hartfield, and his good nature, from his fortune,\n",
      "his house, and his daughter, he could command the visits of his\n",
      "own little circle, in a great measure, as he liked. He had not much\n",
      "intercourse with any families beyond that circle; his horror of late\n",
      "hours, and large dinner-parties, made him unfit for any acquaintance but\n",
      "such as would visit him on his own terms. Fortunately for him, Highbury,\n",
      "including Randalls in the same parish, and Donwell Abbey in the parish\n",
      "adjoining, the seat of Mr. Knightley, comprehended many such. Not\n",
      "unfrequently, through Emma's persuasion, he had some of the chosen and\n",
      "the best to dine with him: but evening parties were what he preferred;\n",
      "and, unless he fancied himself at any time unequal to company, there\n",
      "was scarcely an evening in the week in which Emma could not make up a\n",
      "card-table for him.\n",
      "\n",
      "Real, long-standing regard brought the Westons and Mr. Knightley; and by\n",
      "Mr. Elton, a young man living alone without liking it, the privilege\n",
      "of exchanging any vacant evening of his own blank solitude for the\n",
      "elegancies and society of Mr. Woodhouse's drawing-room, and the smiles\n",
      "of his lovely daughter, was in no danger of being thrown away.\n",
      "\n",
      "After these came a second set; among the most come-at-able of whom were\n",
      "Mrs. and Miss Bates, and Mrs. Goddard, three ladies almost always at\n",
      "the service of an invitation from Hartfield, and who were fetched and\n",
      "carried home so often, that Mr. Woodhouse thought it no hardship for\n",
      "either James or the horses. Had it taken place only once a year, it\n",
      "would have been a grievance.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Bates, the widow of a former vicar of Highbury, was a very old\n",
      "lady, almost past every thing but tea and quadrille. She lived with her\n",
      "single daughter in a very small way, and was considered with all the\n",
      "regard and respect which a harmless old lady, under such untoward\n",
      "circumstances, can excite. Her daughter enjoyed a most uncommon degree\n",
      "of popularity for a woman neither young, handsome, rich, nor married.\n",
      "Miss Bates stood in the very worst predicament in the world for having\n",
      "much of the public favour; and she had no intellectual superiority to\n",
      "make atonement to herself, or frighten those who might hate her into\n",
      "outward respect. She had never boasted either beauty or cleverness. Her\n",
      "youth had passed without distinction, and her middle of life was devoted\n",
      "to the care of a failing mother, and the endeavour to make a small\n",
      "income go as far as possible. And yet she was a happy woman, and a woman\n",
      "whom no one named without good-will. It was her own universal good-will\n",
      "and contented temper which worked such wonders. She loved every body,\n",
      "was interested in every body's happiness, quicksighted to every body's\n",
      "merits; thought herself a most fortunate creature, and surrounded with\n",
      "blessings in such an excellent mother, and so many good neighbours\n",
      "and friends, and a home that wanted for nothing. The simplicity and\n",
      "cheerfulness of her nature, her contented and grateful spirit, were a\n",
      "recommendation to every body, and a mine of felicity to herself. She was\n",
      "a great talker upon little matters, which exactly suited Mr. Woodhouse,\n",
      "full of trivial communications and harmless gossip.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Goddard was the mistress of a School--not of a seminary, or an\n",
      "establishment, or any thing which professed, in long sentences of\n",
      "refined nonsense, to combine liberal acquirements with elegant morality,\n",
      "upon new principles and new systems--and where young ladies for enormous\n",
      "pay might be screwed out of health and into vanity--but a real,\n",
      "honest, old-fashioned Boarding-school, where a reasonable quantity of\n",
      "accomplishments were sold at a reasonable price, and where girls might\n",
      "be sent to be out of the way, and scramble themselves into a little\n",
      "education, without any danger of coming back prodigies. Mrs. Goddard's\n",
      "school was in high repute--and very deservedly; for Highbury was\n",
      "reckoned a particularly healthy spot: she had an ample house and garden,\n",
      "gave the children plenty of wholesome food, let them run about a great\n",
      "deal in the summer, and in winter dressed their chilblains with her own\n",
      "hands. It was no wonder that a train of twenty young couple now walked\n",
      "after her to church. She was a plain, motherly kind of woman, who\n",
      "had worked hard in her youth, and now thought herself entitled to the\n",
      "occasional holiday of a tea-visit; and having formerly owed much to Mr.\n",
      "Woodhouse's kindness, felt his particular claim on her to leave her neat\n",
      "parlour, hung round with fancy-work, whenever she could, and win or lose\n",
      "a few sixpences by his fireside.\n",
      "\n",
      "These were the ladies whom Emma found herself very frequently able to\n",
      "collect; and happy was she, for her father's sake, in the power; though,\n",
      "as far as she was herself concerned, it was no remedy for the absence of\n",
      "Mrs. Weston. She was delighted to see her father look comfortable, and\n",
      "very much pleased with herself for contriving things so well; but the\n",
      "quiet prosings of three such women made her feel that every evening so\n",
      "spent was indeed one of the long evenings she had fearfully anticipated.\n",
      "\n",
      "As she sat one morning, looking forward to exactly such a close of the\n",
      "present day, a note was brought from Mrs. Goddard, requesting, in most\n",
      "respectful terms, to be allowed to bring Miss Smith with her; a most\n",
      "welcome request: for Miss Smith was a girl of seventeen, whom Emma knew\n",
      "very well by sight, and had long felt an interest in, on account of\n",
      "her beauty. A very gracious invitation was returned, and the evening no\n",
      "longer dreaded by the fair mistress of the mansion.\n",
      "\n",
      "Harriet Smith was the natural daughter of somebody. Somebody had placed\n",
      "her, several years back, at Mrs. Goddard's school, and somebody\n",
      "had lately raised her from the condition of scholar to that of\n",
      "parlour-boarder. This was all that was generally known of her history.\n",
      "She had no visible friends but what had been acquired at Highbury, and\n",
      "was now just returned from a long visit in the country to some young\n",
      "ladies who had been at school there with her.\n",
      "\n",
      "She was a very pretty girl, and her beauty happened to be of a sort\n",
      "which Emma particularly admired. She was short, plump, and fair, with a\n",
      "fine bloom, blue eyes, light hair, regular features, and a look of great\n",
      "sweetness, and, before the end of the evening, Emma was as much pleased\n",
      "with her manners as her person, and quite determined to continue the\n",
      "acquaintance.\n",
      "\n",
      "She was not struck by any thing remarkably clever in Miss Smith's\n",
      "conversation, but she found her altogether very engaging--not\n",
      "inconveniently shy, not unwilling to talk--and yet so far from pushing,\n",
      "shewing so proper and becoming a deference, seeming so pleasantly\n",
      "grateful for being admitted to Hartfield, and so artlessly impressed\n",
      "by the appearance of every thing in so superior a style to what she had\n",
      "been used to, that she must have good sense, and deserve encouragement.\n",
      "Encouragement should be given. Those soft blue eyes, and all those\n",
      "natural graces, should not be wasted on the inferior society of Highbury\n",
      "and its connexions. The acquaintance she had already formed were\n",
      "unworthy of her. The friends from whom she had just parted, though very\n",
      "good sort of people, must be doing her harm. They were a family of the\n",
      "name of Martin, whom Emma well knew by character, as renting a large\n",
      "farm of Mr. Knightley, and residing in the parish of Donwell--very\n",
      "creditably, she believed--she knew Mr. Knightley thought highly of\n",
      "them--but they must be coarse and unpolished, and very unfit to be the\n",
      "intimates of a girl who wanted only a little more knowledge and elegance\n",
      "to be quite perfect. _She_ would notice her; she would improve her; she\n",
      "would detach her from her bad acquaintance, and introduce her into good\n",
      "society; she would form her opinions and her manners. It would be an\n",
      "interesting, and certainly a very kind undertaking; highly becoming her\n",
      "own situation in life, her leisure, and powers.\n",
      "\n",
      "She was so busy in admiring those soft blue eyes, in talking and\n",
      "listening, and forming all these schemes in the in-betweens, that the\n",
      "evening flew away at a very unusual rate; and the supper-table, which\n",
      "always closed such parties, and for which she had been used to sit and\n",
      "watch the due time, was all set out and ready, and moved forwards to the\n",
      "fire, before she was aware. With an alacrity beyond the common impulse\n",
      "of a spirit which yet was never indifferent to the credit of doing every\n",
      "thing well and attentively, with the real good-will of a mind delighted\n",
      "with its own ideas, did she then do all the honours of the meal, and\n",
      "help and recommend the minced chicken and scalloped oysters, with an\n",
      "urgency which she knew would be acceptable to the early hours and civil\n",
      "scruples of their guests.\n",
      "\n",
      "Upon such occasions poor Mr. Woodhouse's feelings were in sad warfare.\n",
      "He loved to have the cloth laid, because it had been the fashion of his\n",
      "youth, but his conviction of suppers being very unwholesome made him\n",
      "rather sorry to see any thing put on it; and while his hospitality would\n",
      "have welcomed his visitors to every thing, his care for their health\n",
      "made him grieve that they would eat.\n",
      "\n",
      "Such another small basin of thin gruel as his own was all that he could,\n",
      "with thorough self-approbation, recommend; though he might constrain\n",

      "quite equal to her intentions. Miss Woodhouse was so great a personage\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Harriet Smith's intimacy at Hartfield was soon a settled thing. Quick\n",
      "and decided in her ways, Emma lost no time in inviting, encouraging, and\n",
      "telling her to come very often; and as their acquaintance increased, so\n",
      "did their satisfaction in each other. As a walking companion, Emma had\n",
      "very early foreseen how useful she might find her. In that respect\n",
      "Mrs. Weston's loss had been important. Her father never went beyond the\n",
      "shrubbery, where two divisions of the ground sufficed him for his long\n",
      "walk, or his short, as the year varied; and since Mrs. Weston's marriage\n",
      "her exercise had been too much confined. She had ventured once alone to\n",
      "Randalls, but it was not pleasant; and a Harriet Smith, therefore,\n",
      "one whom she could summon at any time to a walk, would be a valuable\n",
      "addition to her privileges. But in every respect, as she saw more of\n",
      "her, she approved her, and was confirmed in all her kind designs.\n",
      "\n",
      "Harriet certainly was not clever, but she had a sweet, docile, grateful\n",
      "disposition, was totally free from conceit, and only desiring to be\n",
      "guided by any one she looked up to. Her early attachment to herself\n",
      "was very amiable; and her inclination for good company, and power of\n",
      "appreciating what was elegant and clever, shewed that there was no\n",
      "want of taste, though strength of understanding must not be expected.\n",
      "Altogether she was quite convinced of Harriet Smith's being exactly the\n",
      "young friend she wanted--exactly the something which her home required.\n",
      "Such a friend as Mrs. Weston was out of the question. Two such could\n",
      "never be granted. Two such she did not want. It was quite a different\n",
      "sort of thing, a sentiment distinct and independent. Mrs. Weston was the\n",
      "object of a regard which had its basis in gratitude and esteem. Harriet\n",
      "would be loved as one to whom she could be useful. For Mrs. Weston there\n",
      "was nothing to be done; for Harriet every thing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Her first attempts at usefulness were in an endeavour to find out who\n",
      "were the parents, but Harriet could not tell. She was ready to tell\n",
      "every thing in her power, but on this subject questions were vain. Emma\n",
      "was obliged to fancy what she liked--but she could never believe that in\n",
      "the same situation _she_ should not have discovered the truth. Harriet\n",
      "had no penetration. She had been satisfied to hear and believe just what\n",
      "Mrs. Goddard chose to tell her; and looked no farther.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Goddard, and the teachers, and the girls and the affairs of\n",
      "the school in general, formed naturally a great part of the\n",
      "conversation--and but for her acquaintance with the Martins of\n",
      "Abbey-Mill Farm, it must have been the whole. But the Martins occupied\n",
      "her thoughts a good deal; she had spent two very happy months with them,\n",
      "and now loved to talk of the pleasures of her visit, and describe\n",
      "the many comforts and wonders of the place. Emma encouraged her\n",
      "talkativeness--amused by such a picture of another set of beings,\n",
      "and enjoying the youthful simplicity which could speak with so much\n",
      "exultation of Mrs. Martin's having “_two_ parlours, two very good\n",
      "parlours, indeed; one of them quite as large as Mrs. Goddard's\n",
      "drawing-room; and of her having an upper maid who had lived\n",
      "five-and-twenty years with her; and of their having eight cows, two of\n",
      "them Alderneys, and one a little Welch cow, a very pretty little Welch\n",
      "cow indeed; and of Mrs. Martin's saying as she was so fond of it,\n",
      "it should be called _her_ cow; and of their having a very handsome\n",
      "summer-house in their garden, where some day next year they were all to\n",
      "drink tea:--a very handsome summer-house, large enough to hold a dozen\n",
      "people.”\n",
      "\n",
      "For some time she was amused, without thinking beyond the immediate\n",
      "cause; but as she came to understand the family better, other feelings\n",
      "arose. She had taken up a wrong idea, fancying it was a mother and\n",
      "daughter, a son and son's wife, who all lived together; but when it\n",
      "appeared that the Mr. Martin, who bore a part in the narrative, and was\n",
      "always mentioned with approbation for his great good-nature in doing\n",
      "something or other, was a single man; that there was no young Mrs.\n",
      "Martin, no wife in the case; she did suspect danger to her poor little\n",
      "friend from all this hospitality and kindness, and that, if she were not\n",
      "taken care of, she might be required to sink herself forever.\n",
      "\n",
      "With this inspiriting notion, her questions increased in number and\n",
      "meaning; and she particularly led Harriet to talk more of Mr. Martin,\n",
      "and there was evidently no dislike to it. Harriet was very ready to\n",
      "speak of the share he had had in their moonlight walks and merry evening\n",
      "games; and dwelt a good deal upon his being so very good-humoured and\n",
      "obliging. He had gone three miles round one day in order to bring her\n",
      "some walnuts, because she had said how fond she was of them, and in\n",
      "every thing else he was so very obliging. He had his shepherd's son into\n",
      "the parlour one night on purpose to sing to her. She was very fond\n",
      "of singing. He could sing a little himself. She believed he was very\n",
      "clever, and understood every thing. He had a very fine flock, and, while\n",
      "she was with them, he had been bid more for his wool than any body in\n",
      "the country. She believed every body spoke well of him. His mother and\n",
      "sisters were very fond of him. Mrs. Martin had told her one day (and\n",
      "there was a blush as she said it,) that it was impossible for any body\n",
      "to be a better son, and therefore she was sure, whenever he married, he\n",
      "would make a good husband. Not that she _wanted_ him to marry. She was\n",
      "in no hurry at all.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well done, Mrs. Martin!” thought Emma. “You know what you are about.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“And when she had come away, Mrs. Martin was so very kind as to send\n",
      "Mrs. Goddard a beautiful goose--the finest goose Mrs. Goddard had ever\n",
      "seen. Mrs. Goddard had dressed it on a Sunday, and asked all the three\n",
      "teachers, Miss Nash, and Miss Prince, and Miss Richardson, to sup with\n",
      "her.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Mr. Martin, I suppose, is not a man of information beyond the line of\n",
      "his own business? He does not read?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh yes!--that is, no--I do not know--but I believe he has read a\n",
      "good deal--but not what you would think any thing of. He reads the\n",
      "Agricultural Reports, and some other books that lay in one of the window\n",
      "seats--but he reads all _them_ to himself. But sometimes of an evening,\n",
      "before we went to cards, he would read something aloud out of the\n",
      "Elegant Extracts, very entertaining. And I know he has read the Vicar of\n",
      "Wakefield. He never read the Romance of the Forest, nor The Children of\n",
      "the Abbey. He had never heard of such books before I mentioned them, but\n",
      "he is determined to get them now as soon as ever he can.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The next question was--\n",
      "\n",
      "“What sort of looking man is Mr. Martin?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh! not handsome--not at all handsome. I thought him very plain at\n",
      "first, but I do not think him so plain now. One does not, you know,\n",
      "after a time. But did you never see him? He is in Highbury every now and\n",
      "then, and he is sure to ride through every week in his way to Kingston.\n",
      "He has passed you very often.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“That may be, and I may have seen him fifty times, but without having\n",
      "any idea of his name. A young farmer, whether on horseback or on foot,\n",
      "is the very last sort of person to raise my curiosity. The yeomanry are\n",
      "precisely the order of people with whom I feel I can have nothing to do.\n",
      "A degree or two lower, and a creditable appearance might interest me;\n",
      "I might hope to be useful to their families in some way or other. But\n",
      "a farmer can need none of my help, and is, therefore, in one sense, as\n",
      "much above my notice as in every other he is below it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“To be sure. Oh yes! It is not likely you should ever have observed him;\n",
      "but he knows you very well indeed--I mean by sight.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I have no doubt of his being a very respectable young man. I know,\n",
      "indeed, that he is so, and, as such, wish him well. What do you imagine\n",
      "his age to be?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“He was four-and-twenty the 8th of last June, and my birthday is the\n",
      "23rd just a fortnight and a day's difference--which is very odd.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Only four-and-twenty. That is too young to settle. His mother is\n",
      "perfectly right not to be in a hurry. They seem very comfortable as they\n",
      "are, and if she were to take any pains to marry him, she would probably\n",
      "repent it. Six years hence, if he could meet with a good sort of young\n",
      "woman in the same rank as his own, with a little money, it might be very\n",
      "desirable.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Six years hence! Dear Miss Woodhouse, he would be thirty years old!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, and that is as early as most men can afford to marry, who are not\n",
      "born to an independence. Mr. Martin, I imagine, has his fortune entirely\n",
      "to make--cannot be at all beforehand with the world. Whatever money he\n",
      "might come into when his father died, whatever his share of the family\n",
      "property, it is, I dare say, all afloat, all employed in his stock, and\n",
      "so forth; and though, with diligence and good luck, he may be rich in\n",
      "time, it is next to impossible that he should have realised any thing\n",
      "yet.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“To be sure, so it is. But they live very comfortably. They have no\n",
      "indoors man, else they do not want for any thing; and Mrs. Martin talks\n",
      "of taking a boy another year.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I wish you may not get into a scrape, Harriet, whenever he does\n",
      "marry;--I mean, as to being acquainted with his wife--for though his\n",
      "sisters, from a superior education, are not to be altogether objected\n",
      "to, it does not follow that he might marry any body at all fit for you\n",
      "to notice. The misfortune of your birth ought to make you particularly\n",
      "careful as to your associates. There can be no doubt of your being a\n",
      "gentleman's daughter, and you must support your claim to that station by\n",
      "every thing within your own power, or there will be plenty of people who\n",
      "would take pleasure in degrading you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, to be sure, I suppose there are. But while I visit at Hartfield,\n",

      "\n",
      "“You understand the force of influence pretty well, Harriet; but I would\n",
      "have you so firmly established in good society, as to be independent\n",
      "even of Hartfield and Miss Woodhouse. I want to see you permanently\n",
      "well connected, and to that end it will be advisable to have as few odd\n",
      "acquaintance as may be; and, therefore, I say that if you should still\n",
      "be in this country when Mr. Martin marries, I wish you may not be drawn\n",
      "in by your intimacy with the sisters, to be acquainted with the wife,\n",
      "who will probably be some mere farmer's daughter, without education.”\n",
      "\n",

      "I do not mean to set up my opinion against yours--and I am sure I shall\n",
      "not wish for the acquaintance of his wife. I shall always have a great\n",
      "regard for the Miss Martins, especially Elizabeth, and should be very\n",
      "sorry to give them up, for they are quite as well educated as me. But\n",

      "\n",
      "Emma watched her through the fluctuations of this speech, and saw no\n",
      "alarming symptoms of love. The young man had been the first admirer, but\n",
      "she trusted there was no other hold, and that there would be no serious\n",
      "difficulty, on Harriet's side, to oppose any friendly arrangement of her\n",
      "own.\n",
      "\n",
      "They met Mr. Martin the very next day, as they were walking on the\n",
      "Donwell road. He was on foot, and after looking very respectfully at\n",
      "her, looked with most unfeigned satisfaction at her companion. Emma was\n",
      "not sorry to have such an opportunity of survey; and walking a few\n",
      "yards forward, while they talked together, soon made her quick eye\n",
      "sufficiently acquainted with Mr. Robert Martin. His appearance was very\n",
      "neat, and he looked like a sensible young man, but his person had no\n",
      "other advantage; and when he came to be contrasted with gentlemen,\n",
      "she thought he must lose all the ground he had gained in Harriet's\n",
      "inclination. Harriet was not insensible of manner; she had voluntarily\n",
      "noticed her father's gentleness with admiration as well as wonder. Mr.\n",
      "Martin looked as if he did not know what manner was.\n",
      "\n",
      "They remained but a few minutes together, as Miss Woodhouse must not be\n",
      "kept waiting; and Harriet then came running to her with a smiling face,\n",
      "and in a flutter of spirits, which Miss Woodhouse hoped very soon to\n",
      "compose.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Only think of our happening to meet him!--How very odd! It was quite\n",
      "a chance, he said, that he had not gone round by Randalls. He did not\n",
      "think we ever walked this road. He thought we walked towards Randalls\n",
      "most days. He has not been able to get the Romance of the Forest yet.\n",
      "He was so busy the last time he was at Kingston that he quite forgot it,\n",
      "but he goes again to-morrow. So very odd we should happen to meet! Well,\n",
      "Miss Woodhouse, is he like what you expected? What do you think of him?\n",
      "Do you think him so very plain?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“He is very plain, undoubtedly--remarkably plain:--but that is nothing\n",
      "compared with his entire want of gentility. I had no right to expect\n",
      "much, and I did not expect much; but I had no idea that he could be so\n",
      "very clownish, so totally without air. I had imagined him, I confess, a\n",
      "degree or two nearer gentility.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“To be sure,” said Harriet, in a mortified voice, “he is not so genteel\n",
      "as real gentlemen.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I think, Harriet, since your acquaintance with us, you have been\n",
      "repeatedly in the company of some such very real gentlemen, that you\n",
      "must yourself be struck with the difference in Mr. Martin. At Hartfield,\n",
      "you have had very good specimens of well educated, well bred men. I\n",
      "should be surprized if, after seeing them, you could be in company\n",
      "with Mr. Martin again without perceiving him to be a very inferior\n",
      "creature--and rather wondering at yourself for having ever thought him\n",
      "at all agreeable before. Do not you begin to feel that now? Were not\n",
      "you struck? I am sure you must have been struck by his awkward look and\n",
      "abrupt manner, and the uncouthness of a voice which I heard to be wholly\n",
      "unmodulated as I stood here.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Certainly, he is not like Mr. Knightley. He has not such a fine air and\n",
      "way of walking as Mr. Knightley. I see the difference plain enough. But\n",
      "Mr. Knightley is so very fine a man!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Mr. Knightley's air is so remarkably good that it is not fair to\n",
      "compare Mr. Martin with _him_. You might not see one in a hundred with\n",
      "_gentleman_ so plainly written as in Mr. Knightley. But he is not the\n",
      "only gentleman you have been lately used to. What say you to Mr. Weston\n",
      "and Mr. Elton? Compare Mr. Martin with either of _them_. Compare their\n",
      "manner of carrying themselves; of walking; of speaking; of being silent.\n",
      "You must see the difference.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh yes!--there is a great difference. But Mr. Weston is almost an old\n",
      "man. Mr. Weston must be between forty and fifty.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Which makes his good manners the more valuable. The older a person\n",
      "grows, Harriet, the more important it is that their manners should not\n",
      "be bad; the more glaring and disgusting any loudness, or coarseness, or\n",
      "awkwardness becomes. What is passable in youth is detestable in later\n",
      "age. Mr. Martin is now awkward and abrupt; what will he be at Mr.\n",
      "Weston's time of life?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“There is no saying, indeed,” replied Harriet rather solemnly.\n",
      "\n",
      "“But there may be pretty good guessing. He will be a completely gross,\n",
      "vulgar farmer, totally inattentive to appearances, and thinking of\n",
      "nothing but profit and loss.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Will he, indeed? That will be very bad.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“How much his business engrosses him already is very plain from the\n",
      "circumstance of his forgetting to inquire for the book you recommended.\n",
      "He was a great deal too full of the market to think of any thing\n",
      "else--which is just as it should be, for a thriving man. What has he to\n",
      "do with books? And I have no doubt that he _will_ thrive, and be a very\n",
      "rich man in time--and his being illiterate and coarse need not disturb\n",
      "_us_.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I wonder he did not remember the book”--was all Harriet's answer, and\n",
      "spoken with a degree of grave displeasure which Emma thought might be\n",
      "safely left to itself. She, therefore, said no more for some time. Her\n",
      "next beginning was,\n",
      "\n",
      "“In one respect, perhaps, Mr. Elton's manners are superior to Mr.\n",
      "Knightley's or Mr. Weston's. They have more gentleness. They might be\n",
      "more safely held up as a pattern. There is an openness, a quickness,\n",
      "almost a bluntness in Mr. Weston, which every body likes in _him_,\n",
      "because there is so much good-humour with it--but that would not do to\n",
      "be copied. Neither would Mr. Knightley's downright, decided, commanding\n",
      "sort of manner, though it suits _him_ very well; his figure, and look,\n",
      "and situation in life seem to allow it; but if any young man were to set\n",
      "about copying him, he would not be sufferable. On the contrary, I think\n",
      "a young man might be very safely recommended to take Mr. Elton as a\n",
      "model. Mr. Elton is good-humoured, cheerful, obliging, and gentle.\n",
      "He seems to me to be grown particularly gentle of late. I do not know\n",
      "whether he has any design of ingratiating himself with either of us,\n",
      "Harriet, by additional softness, but it strikes me that his manners are\n",
      "softer than they used to be. If he means any thing, it must be to please\n",
      "you. Did not I tell you what he said of you the other day?”\n",
      "\n",
      "She then repeated some warm personal praise which she had drawn from Mr.\n",
      "Elton, and now did full justice to; and Harriet blushed and smiled, and\n",
      "said she had always thought Mr. Elton very agreeable.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Elton was the very person fixed on by Emma for driving the young\n",
      "farmer out of Harriet's head. She thought it would be an excellent\n",
      "match; and only too palpably desirable, natural, and probable, for her\n",
      "to have much merit in planning it. She feared it was what every body\n",
      "else must think of and predict. It was not likely, however, that any\n",
      "body should have equalled her in the date of the plan, as it had\n",
      "entered her brain during the very first evening of Harriet's coming to\n",
      "Hartfield. The longer she considered it, the greater was her sense\n",
      "of its expediency. Mr. Elton's situation was most suitable, quite the\n",
      "gentleman himself, and without low connexions; at the same time, not of\n",
      "any family that could fairly object to the doubtful birth of Harriet.\n",
      "He had a comfortable home for her, and Emma imagined a very sufficient\n",
      "income; for though the vicarage of Highbury was not large, he was known\n",
      "to have some independent property; and she thought very highly of him\n",
      "as a good-humoured, well-meaning, respectable young man, without any\n",
      "deficiency of useful understanding or knowledge of the world.\n",
      "\n",
      "She had already satisfied herself that he thought Harriet a beautiful\n",
      "girl, which she trusted, with such frequent meetings at Hartfield, was\n",
      "foundation enough on his side; and on Harriet's there could be little\n",
      "doubt that the idea of being preferred by him would have all the usual\n",
      "weight and efficacy. And he was really a very pleasing young man, a\n",
      "young man whom any woman not fastidious might like. He was reckoned very\n",
      "handsome; his person much admired in general, though not by her,\n",

      "\n",
      "“A bad thing! Do you really think it a bad thing?--why so?”\n",

      "\n",
      "“You surprize me! Emma must do Harriet good: and by supplying her with a\n",
      "new object of interest, Harriet may be said to do Emma good. I have been\n",
      "seeing their intimacy with the greatest pleasure. How very differently\n",
      "we feel!--Not think they will do each other any good! This will\n",
      "certainly be the beginning of one of our quarrels about Emma, Mr.\n",
      "Knightley.”\n",

      "“Perhaps you think I am come on purpose to quarrel with you, knowing\n",
      "Weston to be out, and that you must still fight your own battle.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Mr. Weston would undoubtedly support me, if he were here, for he thinks\n",
      "exactly as I do on the subject. We were speaking of it only yesterday,\n",
      "and agreeing how fortunate it was for Emma, that there should be such a\n",
      "girl in Highbury for her to associate with. Mr. Knightley, I shall not\n",
      "allow you to be a fair judge in this case. You are so much used to live\n",
      "alone, that you do not know the value of a companion; and, perhaps no\n",
      "man can be a good judge of the comfort a woman feels in the society of\n",
      "one of her own sex, after being used to it all her life. I can imagine\n",
      "your objection to Harriet Smith. She is not the superior young woman\n",
      "which Emma's friend ought to be. But on the other hand, as Emma wants\n",
      "to see her better informed, it will be an inducement to her to read more\n",
      "herself. They will read together. She means it, I know.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Emma has been meaning to read more ever since she was twelve years old.\n",
      "I have seen a great many lists of her drawing-up at various times of\n",
      "books that she meant to read regularly through--and very good lists\n",
      "they were--very well chosen, and very neatly arranged--sometimes\n",
      "alphabetically, and sometimes by some other rule. The list she drew\n",
      "up when only fourteen--I remember thinking it did her judgment so much\n",
      "credit, that I preserved it some time; and I dare say she may have made\n",
      "out a very good list now. But I have done with expecting any course of\n",
      "steady reading from Emma. She will never submit to any thing\n",
      "requiring industry and patience, and a subjection of the fancy to the\n",
      "understanding. Where Miss Taylor failed to stimulate, I may safely\n",
      "affirm that Harriet Smith will do nothing.--You never could persuade her\n",
      "to read half so much as you wished.--You know you could not.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I dare say,” replied Mrs. Weston, smiling, “that I thought so\n",
      "_then_;--but since we have parted, I can never remember Emma's omitting\n",
      "to do any thing I wished.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“There is hardly any desiring to refresh such a memory as _that_,”--said\n",

      " he soon added, “who have had no such charm thrown over my senses, must\n",
      "still see, hear, and remember. Emma is spoiled by being the cleverest\n",
      "of her family. At ten years old, she had the misfortune of being able to\n",
      "answer questions which puzzled her sister at seventeen. She was always\n",
      "quick and assured: Isabella slow and diffident. And ever since she\n",
      "was twelve, Emma has been mistress of the house and of you all. In her\n",
      "mother she lost the only person able to cope with her. She inherits her\n",
      "mother's talents, and must have been under subjection to her.”\n",

      "any body. I am sure you always thought me unfit for the office I held.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes,” said he, smiling. “You are better placed _here_; very fit for a\n",
      "wife, but not at all for a governess. But you were preparing yourself to\n",
      "be an excellent wife all the time you were at Hartfield. You might\n",
      "not give Emma such a complete education as your powers would seem to\n",
      "promise; but you were receiving a very good education from _her_, on the\n",
      "very material matrimonial point of submitting your own will, and doing\n",
      "as you were bid; and if Weston had asked me to recommend him a wife, I\n",
      "should certainly have named Miss Taylor.”\n",

      "with every disposition to bear, there will be nothing to be borne. We\n",
      "will not despair, however. Weston may grow cross from the wantonness of\n",
      "comfort, or his son may plague him.”\n",
      "\n",

      "young man may be a Weston in merit, and a Churchill in fortune.--But\n",
      "Harriet Smith--I have not half done about Harriet Smith. I think her the\n",
      "very worst sort of companion that Emma could possibly have. She knows\n",
      "nothing herself, and looks upon Emma as knowing every thing. She is a\n",
      "flatterer in all her ways; and so much the worse, because undesigned.\n",
      "Her ignorance is hourly flattery. How can Emma imagine she has any\n",
      "thing to learn herself, while Harriet is presenting such a delightful\n",
      "inferiority? And as for Harriet, I will venture to say that _she_ cannot\n",
      "gain by the acquaintance. Hartfield will only put her out of conceit\n",
      "with all the other places she belongs to. She will grow just refined\n",
      "enough to be uncomfortable with those among whom birth and circumstances\n",
      "have placed her home. I am much mistaken if Emma's doctrines give any\n",
      "strength of mind, or tend at all to make a girl adapt herself rationally\n",
      "to the varieties of her situation in life.--They only give a little\n",
      "polish.”\n",

      "“I either depend more upon Emma's good sense than you do, or am more\n",
      "anxious for her present comfort; for I cannot lament the acquaintance.\n",
      "How well she looked last night!”\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "“I do not know what I could imagine, but I confess that I have seldom\n",

      "“Such an eye!--the true hazle eye--and so brilliant! regular features,\n",

      "and such a pretty height and size; such a firm and upright figure!\n",
      "There is health, not merely in her bloom, but in her air, her head, her\n",
      "glance. One hears sometimes of a child being 'the picture of health;'\n",
      "now, Emma always gives me the idea of being the complete picture of\n",
      "grown-up health. She is loveliness itself. Mr. Knightley, is not she?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I have not a fault to find with her person,” he replied. “I think her\n",
      "all you describe. I love to look at her; and I will add this praise,\n",
      "that I do not think her personally vain. Considering how very handsome\n",
      "she is, she appears to be little occupied with it; her vanity lies\n",
      "another way. Mrs. Weston, I am not to be talked out of my dislike of\n",

      "\n",

      "excellent creature. Where shall we see a better daughter, or a kinder\n",
      "sister, or a truer friend? No, no; she has qualities which may be\n",
      "trusted; she will never lead any one really wrong; she will make no\n",

      "times.”\n",

      "mother might have had) the liberty of hinting that I do not think any\n",

      "and therefore produced the portfolio containing her various attempts at\n",
      "portraits, for not one of them had ever been finished, that they might\n",

      "displayed. Miniatures, half-lengths, whole-lengths, pencil, crayon, and\n",
      "water-colours had been all tried in turn. She had always wanted to do\n",
      "every thing, and had made more progress both in drawing and music than\n",
      "many might have done with so little labour as she would ever submit to.\n",
      "She played and sang;--and drew in almost every style; but steadiness\n",
      "had always been wanting; and in nothing had she approached the degree of\n",
      "excellence which she would have been glad to command, and ought not to\n",
      "have failed of. She was not much deceived as to her own skill either\n",
      "as an artist or a musician, but she was not unwilling to have others\n",
      "deceived, or sorry to know her reputation for accomplishment often\n",
      "higher than it deserved.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was merit in every drawing--in the least finished, perhaps the\n",
      "most; her style was spirited; but had there been much less, or had there\n",
      "been ten times more, the delight and admiration of her two companions\n",
      "would have been the same. They were both in ecstasies. A likeness\n",
      "pleases every body; and Miss Woodhouse's performances must be capital.\n",
      "\n",
      "“No great variety of faces for you,” said Emma. “I had only my own\n",

      "kindest friend on every occasion. She would sit whenever I asked her.\n",
      "There is my sister; and really quite her own little elegant figure!--and\n",
      "the face not unlike. I should have made a good likeness of her, if she\n",
      "would have sat longer, but she was in such a hurry to have me draw\n",
      "her four children that she would not be quiet. Then, here come all my\n",
      "attempts at three of those four children;--there they are, Henry and\n",
      "John and Bella, from one end of the sheet to the other, and any one of\n",
      "them might do for any one of the rest. She was so eager to have them\n",
      "drawn that I could not refuse; but there is no making children of three\n",
      "or four years old stand still you know; nor can it be very easy to take\n",
      "any likeness of them, beyond the air and complexion, unless they are\n",
      "coarser featured than any of mama's children ever were. Here is my\n",
      "sketch of the fourth, who was a baby. I took him as he was sleeping on\n",
      "the sofa, and it is as strong a likeness of his cockade as you would\n",
      "wish to see. He had nestled down his head most conveniently. That's very\n",
      "like. I am rather proud of little George. The corner of the sofa is very\n",

      "in small size, whole-length--“my last and my best--my brother, Mr. John\n",

      "in a pet, and vowed I would never take another likeness. I could not\n",
      "help being provoked; for after all my pains, and when I had really made\n",
      "a very good likeness of it--(Mrs. Weston and I were quite agreed in\n",
      "thinking it _very_ like)--only too handsome--too flattering--but\n",

      "forswear ever drawing any body again. But for Harriet's sake, or rather\n",
      "for my own, and as there are no husbands and wives in the case _at_\n",
      "_present_, I will break my resolution now.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Elton seemed very properly struck and delighted by the idea, and was\n",
      "repeating, “No husbands and wives in the case at present indeed, as\n",
      "you observe. Exactly so. No husbands and wives,” with so interesting a\n",
      "consciousness, that Emma began to consider whether she had not better\n",
      "leave them together at once. But as she wanted to be drawing, the\n",
      "declaration must wait a little longer.\n",
      "\n",
      "She had soon fixed on the size and sort of portrait. It was to be\n",
      "a whole-length in water-colours, like Mr. John Knightley's, and was\n",
      "destined, if she could please herself, to hold a very honourable station\n",
      "over the mantelpiece.\n",
      "\n",
      "The sitting began; and Harriet, smiling and blushing, and afraid of not\n",
      "keeping her attitude and countenance, presented a very sweet mixture of\n",
      "youthful expression to the steady eyes of the artist. But there was no\n",
      "doing any thing, with Mr. Elton fidgeting behind her and watching every\n",
      "touch. She gave him credit for stationing himself where he might gaze\n",
      "and gaze again without offence; but was really obliged to put an end to\n",
      "it, and request him to place himself elsewhere. It then occurred to her\n",
      "to employ him in reading.\n",
      "\n",
      "“If he would be so good as to read to them, it would be a kindness\n",
      "indeed! It would amuse away the difficulties of her part, and lessen the\n",
      "irksomeness of Miss Smith's.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Elton was only too happy. Harriet listened, and Emma drew in peace.\n",
      "She must allow him to be still frequently coming to look; any thing less\n",
      "would certainly have been too little in a lover; and he was ready at the\n",
      "smallest intermission of the pencil, to jump up and see the progress,\n",
      "and be charmed.--There was no being displeased with such an encourager,\n",
      "for his admiration made him discern a likeness almost before it\n",
      "was possible. She could not respect his eye, but his love and his\n",
      "complaisance were unexceptionable.\n",
      "\n",
      "The sitting was altogether very satisfactory; she was quite enough\n",
      "pleased with the first day's sketch to wish to go on. There was no want\n",
      "of likeness, she had been fortunate in the attitude, and as she meant\n",
      "to throw in a little improvement to the figure, to give a little more\n",
      "height, and considerably more elegance, she had great confidence of\n",
      "its being in every way a pretty drawing at last, and of its filling\n",
      "its destined place with credit to them both--a standing memorial of the\n",
      "beauty of one, the skill of the other, and the friendship of both;\n",
      "with as many other agreeable associations as Mr. Elton's very promising\n",
      "attachment was likely to add.\n",
      "\n",
      "Harriet was to sit again the next day; and Mr. Elton, just as he ought,\n",
      "entreated for the permission of attending and reading to them again.\n",

      "party.”\n",

      "The same civilities and courtesies, the same success and satisfaction,\n",
      "took place on the morrow, and accompanied the whole progress of the\n",
      "picture, which was rapid and happy. Every body who saw it was pleased,\n",
      "but Mr. Elton was in continual raptures, and defended it through every\n",
      "criticism.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Miss Woodhouse has given her friend the only beauty she\n",
      "wanted,”--observed Mrs. Weston to him--not in the least suspecting that\n",
      "she was addressing a lover.--“The expression of the eye is most correct,\n",

      "her face that she has them not.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Do you think so?” replied he. “I cannot agree with you. It appears\n",
      "to me a most perfect resemblance in every feature. I never saw such a\n",
      "likeness in my life. We must allow for the effect of shade, you know.”\n",

      "added,\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh no! certainly not too tall; not in the least too tall. Consider, she\n",
      "is sitting down--which naturally presents a different--which in short\n",
      "gives exactly the idea--and the proportions must be preserved, you know.\n",
      "Proportions, fore-shortening.--Oh no! it gives one exactly the idea of\n",
      "such a height as Miss Smith's. Exactly so indeed!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It is very pretty,” said Mr. Woodhouse. “So prettily done! Just as your\n",
      "drawings always are, my dear. I do not know any body who draws so well\n",
      "as you do. The only thing I do not thoroughly like is, that she seems\n",
      "to be sitting out of doors, with only a little shawl over her\n",
      "shoulders--and it makes one think she must catch cold.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But, my dear papa, it is supposed to be summer; a warm day in summer.\n",
      "Look at the tree.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But it is never safe to sit out of doors, my dear.”\n",
      "\n",

      "I regard it as a most happy thought, the placing of Miss Smith out of\n",
      "doors; and the tree is touched with such inimitable spirit! Any other\n",
      "situation would have been much less in character. The naivete of Miss\n",
      "Smith's manners--and altogether--Oh, it is most admirable! I cannot keep\n",
      "my eyes from it. I never saw such a likeness.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The next thing wanted was to get the picture framed; and here were a few\n",
      "difficulties. It must be done directly; it must be done in London; the\n",
      "order must go through the hands of some intelligent person whose taste\n",
      "could be depended on; and Isabella, the usual doer of all commissions,\n",
      "must not be applied to, because it was December, and Mr. Woodhouse\n",
      "could not bear the idea of her stirring out of her house in the fogs of\n",
      "December. But no sooner was the distress known to Mr. Elton, than it\n",
      "was removed. His gallantry was always on the alert. “Might he be trusted\n",
      "with the commission, what infinite pleasure should he have in executing\n",
      "it! he could ride to London at any time. It was impossible to say how\n",
      "much he should be gratified by being employed on such an errand.”\n",
      "\n",

      "the business.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Elton was to take the drawing to London, chuse the frame, and give\n",
      "the directions; and Emma thought she could so pack it as to ensure its\n",

      "not being incommoded enough.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What a precious deposit!” said he with a tender sigh, as he received\n",
      "it.\n",

      "say so, but that I suppose there may be a hundred different ways of\n",
      "being in love. He is an excellent young man, and will suit Harriet\n",
      "exactly; it will be an 'Exactly so,' as he says himself; but he does\n",
      "sigh and languish, and study for compliments rather more than I could\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The very day of Mr. Elton's going to London produced a fresh occasion\n",
      "for Emma's services towards her friend. Harriet had been at Hartfield,\n",
      "as usual, soon after breakfast; and, after a time, had gone home to\n",
      "return again to dinner: she returned, and sooner than had been\n",
      "talked of, and with an agitated, hurried look, announcing something\n",
      "extraordinary to have happened which she was longing to tell. Half a\n",
      "minute brought it all out. She had heard, as soon as she got back to\n",
      "Mrs. Goddard's, that Mr. Martin had been there an hour before, and\n",
      "finding she was not at home, nor particularly expected, had left a\n",
      "little parcel for her from one of his sisters, and gone away; and on\n",
      "opening this parcel, she had actually found, besides the two songs which\n",
      "she had lent Elizabeth to copy, a letter to herself; and this letter was\n",
      "from him, from Mr. Martin, and contained a direct proposal of marriage.\n",
      "“Who could have thought it? She was so surprized she did not know what\n",
      "to do. Yes, quite a proposal of marriage; and a very good letter,\n",
      "at least she thought so. And he wrote as if he really loved her very\n",
      "much--but she did not know--and so, she was come as fast as she could to\n",
      "ask Miss Woodhouse what she should do.--” Emma was half-ashamed of her\n",
      "friend for seeming so pleased and so doubtful.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Upon my word,” she cried, “the young man is determined not to lose any\n",
      "thing for want of asking. He will connect himself well if he can.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Will you read the letter?” cried Harriet. “Pray do. I'd rather you\n",
      "would.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Emma was not sorry to be pressed. She read, and was surprized. The style\n",
      "of the letter was much above her expectation. There were not merely no\n",
      "grammatical errors, but as a composition it would not have disgraced a\n",
      "gentleman; the language, though plain, was strong and unaffected, and\n",
      "the sentiments it conveyed very much to the credit of the writer. It was\n",
      "short, but expressed good sense, warm attachment, liberality, propriety,\n",
      "even delicacy of feeling. She paused over it, while Harriet stood\n",
      "anxiously watching for her opinion, with a “Well, well,” and was at last\n",
      "forced to add, “Is it a good letter? or is it too short?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, indeed, a very good letter,” replied Emma rather slowly--“so\n",
      "good a letter, Harriet, that every thing considered, I think one of his\n",
      "sisters must have helped him. I can hardly imagine the young man whom\n",
      "I saw talking with you the other day could express himself so well, if\n",
      "left quite to his own powers, and yet it is not the style of a woman;\n",
      "no, certainly, it is too strong and concise; not diffuse enough for a\n",
      "woman. No doubt he is a sensible man, and I suppose may have a natural\n",
      "talent for--thinks strongly and clearly--and when he takes a pen in\n",
      "hand, his thoughts naturally find proper words. It is so with some men.\n",
      "Yes, I understand the sort of mind. Vigorous, decided, with sentiments\n",
      "to a certain point, not coarse. A better written letter, Harriet\n",
      "(returning it,) than I had expected.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well,” said the still waiting Harriet;--“well--and--and what shall I\n",
      "do?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“What shall you do! In what respect? Do you mean with regard to this\n",
      "letter?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But what are you in doubt of? You must answer it of course--and\n",
      "speedily.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes. But what shall I say? Dear Miss Woodhouse, do advise me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh no, no! the letter had much better be all your own. You will express\n",
      "yourself very properly, I am sure. There is no danger of your not\n",
      "being intelligible, which is the first thing. Your meaning must be\n",
      "unequivocal; no doubts or demurs: and such expressions of gratitude\n",
      "and concern for the pain you are inflicting as propriety requires, will\n",
      "present themselves unbidden to _your_ mind, I am persuaded. You need\n",
      "not be prompted to write with the appearance of sorrow for his\n",
      "disappointment.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You think I ought to refuse him then,” said Harriet, looking down.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ought to refuse him! My dear Harriet, what do you mean? Are you in any\n",
      "doubt as to that? I thought--but I beg your pardon, perhaps I have been\n",
      "under a mistake. I certainly have been misunderstanding you, if you feel\n",
      "in doubt as to the _purport_ of your answer. I had imagined you were\n",
      "consulting me only as to the wording of it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Harriet was silent. With a little reserve of manner, Emma continued:\n",
      "\n",
      "“You mean to return a favourable answer, I collect.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No, I do not; that is, I do not mean--What shall I do? What would you\n",
      "advise me to do? Pray, dear Miss Woodhouse, tell me what I ought to do.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I shall not give you any advice, Harriet. I will have nothing to do\n",
      "with it. This is a point which you must settle with your feelings.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I had no notion that he liked me so very much,” said Harriet,\n",
      "contemplating the letter. For a little while Emma persevered in her\n",
      "silence; but beginning to apprehend the bewitching flattery of that\n",
      "letter might be too powerful, she thought it best to say,\n",
      "\n",
      "“I lay it down as a general rule, Harriet, that if a woman _doubts_ as\n",
      "to whether she should accept a man or not, she certainly ought to refuse\n",
      "him. If she can hesitate as to 'Yes,' she ought to say 'No' directly.\n",
      "It is not a state to be safely entered into with doubtful feelings, with\n",
      "half a heart. I thought it my duty as a friend, and older than yourself,\n",
      "to say thus much to you. But do not imagine that I want to influence\n",
      "you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh! no, I am sure you are a great deal too kind to--but if you would\n",
      "just advise me what I had best do--No, no, I do not mean that--As\n",
      "you say, one's mind ought to be quite made up--One should not be\n",
      "hesitating--It is a very serious thing.--It will be safer to say 'No,'\n",
      "perhaps.--Do you think I had better say 'No?'”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Not for the world,” said Emma, smiling graciously, “would I advise you\n",
      "either way. You must be the best judge of your own happiness. If you\n",
      "prefer Mr. Martin to every other person; if you think him the most\n",
      "agreeable man you have ever been in company with, why should you\n",
      "hesitate? You blush, Harriet.--Does any body else occur to you at\n",
      "this moment under such a definition? Harriet, Harriet, do not deceive\n",
      "yourself; do not be run away with by gratitude and compassion. At this\n",
      "moment whom are you thinking of?”\n",
      "\n",
      "The symptoms were favourable.--Instead of answering, Harriet turned away\n",
      "confused, and stood thoughtfully by the fire; and though the letter was\n",
      "still in her hand, it was now mechanically twisted about without regard.\n",
      "Emma waited the result with impatience, but not without strong hopes. At\n",
      "last, with some hesitation, Harriet said--\n",
      "\n",
      "“Miss Woodhouse, as you will not give me your opinion, I must do as well\n",
      "as I can by myself; and I have now quite determined, and really almost\n",
      "made up my mind--to refuse Mr. Martin. Do you think I am right?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Perfectly, perfectly right, my dearest Harriet; you are doing just\n",
      "what you ought. While you were at all in suspense I kept my feelings to\n",
      "myself, but now that you are so completely decided I have no hesitation\n",
      "in approving. Dear Harriet, I give myself joy of this. It would\n",
      "have grieved me to lose your acquaintance, which must have been the\n",
      "consequence of your marrying Mr. Martin. While you were in the smallest\n",
      "degree wavering, I said nothing about it, because I would not influence;\n",
      "but it would have been the loss of a friend to me. I could not have\n",
      "visited Mrs. Robert Martin, of Abbey-Mill Farm. Now I am secure of you\n",
      "for ever.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Harriet had not surmised her own danger, but the idea of it struck her\n",
      "forcibly.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You could not have visited me!” she cried, looking aghast. “No, to be\n",
      "sure you could not; but I never thought of that before. That would have\n",
      "been too dreadful!--What an escape!--Dear Miss Woodhouse, I would not\n",
      "give up the pleasure and honour of being intimate with you for any thing\n",
      "in the world.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Indeed, Harriet, it would have been a severe pang to lose you; but it\n",
      "must have been. You would have thrown yourself out of all good society.\n",
      "I must have given you up.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Dear me!--How should I ever have borne it! It would have killed me\n",
      "never to come to Hartfield any more!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Dear affectionate creature!--_You_ banished to Abbey-Mill Farm!--_You_\n",
      "confined to the society of the illiterate and vulgar all your life! I\n",
      "wonder how the young man could have the assurance to ask it. He must\n",
      "have a pretty good opinion of himself.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I do not think he is conceited either, in general,” said Harriet, her\n",
      "conscience opposing such censure; “at least, he is very good natured,\n",
      "and I shall always feel much obliged to him, and have a great regard\n",
      "for--but that is quite a different thing from--and you know, though\n",
      "he may like me, it does not follow that I should--and certainly I must\n",
      "confess that since my visiting here I have seen people--and if one comes\n",
      "to compare them, person and manners, there is no comparison at all,\n",
      "_one_ is so very handsome and agreeable. However, I do really think Mr.\n",
      "Martin a very amiable young man, and have a great opinion of him; and\n",
      "his being so much attached to me--and his writing such a letter--but as\n",
      "to leaving you, it is what I would not do upon any consideration.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Thank you, thank you, my own sweet little friend. We will not be\n",
      "parted. A woman is not to marry a man merely because she is asked, or\n",
      "because he is attached to her, and can write a tolerable letter.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh no;--and it is but a short letter too.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Emma felt the bad taste of her friend, but let it pass with a “very\n",
      "true; and it would be a small consolation to her, for the clownish\n",
      "manner which might be offending her every hour of the day, to know that\n",
      "her husband could write a good letter.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh! yes, very. Nobody cares for a letter; the thing is, to be always\n",

      "how shall I do? What shall I say?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Emma assured her there would be no difficulty in the answer, and advised\n",
      "its being written directly, which was agreed to, in the hope of her\n",
      "assistance; and though Emma continued to protest against any assistance\n",
      "being wanted, it was in fact given in the formation of every sentence.\n",
      "The looking over his letter again, in replying to it, had such a\n",
      "softening tendency, that it was particularly necessary to brace her up\n",
      "with a few decisive expressions; and she was so very much concerned at\n",
      "the idea of making him unhappy, and thought so much of what his mother\n",
      "and sisters would think and say, and was so anxious that they should not\n",

      "the rejected Mr. Martin.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Now he has got my letter,” said she softly. “I wonder what they are all\n",

      "just before he mounts his horse to-morrow. It is his companion all this\n",
      "evening, his solace, his delight. It opens his designs to his family,\n",

      "Harriet slept at Hartfield that night. For some weeks past she had been\n",
      "spending more than half her time there, and gradually getting to have\n",
      "a bed-room appropriated to herself; and Emma judged it best in every\n",
      "respect, safest and kindest, to keep her with them as much as possible\n",
      "just at present. She was obliged to go the next morning for an hour or\n",
      "two to Mrs. Goddard's, but it was then to be settled that she should\n",
      "return to Hartfield, to make a regular visit of some days.\n",
      "\n",
      "While she was gone, Mr. Knightley called, and sat some time with Mr.\n",
      "Woodhouse and Emma, till Mr. Woodhouse, who had previously made up his\n",
      "mind to walk out, was persuaded by his daughter not to defer it, and was\n",
      "induced by the entreaties of both, though against the scruples of his\n",
      "own civility, to leave Mr. Knightley for that purpose. Mr. Knightley,\n",
      "who had nothing of ceremony about him, was offering by his short,\n",
      "decided answers, an amusing contrast to the protracted apologies and\n",
      "civil hesitations of the other.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, I believe, if you will excuse me, Mr. Knightley, if you will not\n",
      "consider me as doing a very rude thing, I shall take Emma's advice and\n",
      "go out for a quarter of an hour. As the sun is out, I believe I had\n",
      "better take my three turns while I can. I treat you without ceremony,\n",
      "Mr. Knightley. We invalids think we are privileged people.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“My dear sir, do not make a stranger of me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I leave an excellent substitute in my daughter. Emma will be happy to\n",
      "entertain you. And therefore I think I will beg your excuse and take my\n",
      "three turns--my winter walk.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You cannot do better, sir.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I would ask for the pleasure of your company, Mr. Knightley, but I am a\n",
      "very slow walker, and my pace would be tedious to you; and, besides, you\n",

      "\n",
      "“Thank you, sir, thank you; I am going this moment myself; and I think\n",

      "\n",
      "Mr. Woodhouse at last was off; but Mr. Knightley, instead of being\n",
      "immediately off likewise, sat down again, seemingly inclined for more\n",
      "chat. He began speaking of Harriet, and speaking of her with more\n",
      "voluntary praise than Emma had ever heard before.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I cannot rate her beauty as you do,” said he; “but she is a\n",
      "pretty little creature, and I am inclined to think very well of her\n",
      "disposition. Her character depends upon those she is with; but in good\n",
      "hands she will turn out a valuable woman.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I am glad you think so; and the good hands, I hope, may not be\n",

      "\n",
      "“Come,” said he, “you are anxious for a compliment, so I will tell you\n",
      "that you have improved her. You have cured her of her school-girl's\n",
      "giggle; she really does you credit.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Thank you. I should be mortified indeed if I did not believe I had been\n",
      "of some use; but it is not every body who will bestow praise where they\n",
      "may. _You_ do not often overpower me with it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You are expecting her again, you say, this morning?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Almost every moment. She has been gone longer already than she\n",
      "intended.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Something has happened to delay her; some visitors perhaps.”\n",
      "\n",

      "“Harriet may not consider every body tiresome that you would.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Emma knew this was too true for contradiction, and therefore said\n",
      "nothing. He presently added, with a smile,\n",
      "\n",
      "“I do not pretend to fix on times or places, but I must tell you that\n",
      "I have good reason to believe your little friend will soon hear of\n",
      "something to her advantage.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Indeed! how so? of what sort?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“A very serious sort, I assure you;” still smiling.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Very serious! I can think of but one thing--Who is in love with her?\n",

      "\n",
      "Emma was more than half in hopes of Mr. Elton's having dropt a hint.\n",
      "Mr. Knightley was a sort of general friend and adviser, and she knew Mr.\n",
      "Elton looked up to him.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I have reason to think,” he replied, “that Harriet Smith will soon have\n",
      "an offer of marriage, and from a most unexceptionable quarter:--Robert\n",
      "Martin is the man. Her visit to Abbey-Mill, this summer, seems to have\n",
      "done his business. He is desperately in love and means to marry her.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“He is very obliging,” said Emma; “but is he sure that Harriet means to\n",
      "marry him?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, well, means to make her an offer then. Will that do? He came to\n",
      "the Abbey two evenings ago, on purpose to consult me about it. He knows\n",
      "I have a thorough regard for him and all his family, and, I believe,\n",
      "considers me as one of his best friends. He came to ask me whether\n",
      "I thought it would be imprudent in him to settle so early; whether\n",
      "I thought her too young: in short, whether I approved his choice\n",
      "altogether; having some apprehension perhaps of her being considered\n",
      "(especially since _your_ making so much of her) as in a line of society\n",
      "above him. I was very much pleased with all that he said. I never hear\n",
      "better sense from any one than Robert Martin. He always speaks to the\n",
      "purpose; open, straightforward, and very well judging. He told me every\n",
      "thing; his circumstances and plans, and what they all proposed doing in\n",
      "the event of his marriage. He is an excellent young man, both as son and\n",
      "brother. I had no hesitation in advising him to marry. He proved to me\n",
      "that he could afford it; and that being the case, I was convinced he\n",
      "could not do better. I praised the fair lady too, and altogether sent\n",
      "him away very happy. If he had never esteemed my opinion before, he\n",
      "would have thought highly of me then; and, I dare say, left the house\n",
      "thinking me the best friend and counsellor man ever had. This happened\n",
      "the night before last. Now, as we may fairly suppose, he would not allow\n",
      "much time to pass before he spoke to the lady, and as he does not appear\n",
      "to have spoken yesterday, it is not unlikely that he should be at Mrs.\n",
      "Goddard's to-day; and she may be detained by a visitor, without thinking\n",
      "him at all a tiresome wretch.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Pray, Mr. Knightley,” said Emma, who had been smiling to herself\n",
      "through a great part of this speech, “how do you know that Mr. Martin\n",
      "did not speak yesterday?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Certainly,” replied he, surprized, “I do not absolutely know it; but it\n",
      "may be inferred. Was not she the whole day with you?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Come,” said she, “I will tell you something, in return for what\n",
      "you have told me. He did speak yesterday--that is, he wrote, and was\n",
      "refused.”\n",
      "\n",
      "This was obliged to be repeated before it could be believed; and Mr.\n",
      "Knightley actually looked red with surprize and displeasure, as he stood\n",
      "up, in tall indignation, and said,\n",
      "\n",
      "“Then she is a greater simpleton than I ever believed her. What is the\n",
      "foolish girl about?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh! to be sure,” cried Emma, “it is always incomprehensible to a man\n",
      "that a woman should ever refuse an offer of marriage. A man always\n",
      "imagines a woman to be ready for any body who asks her.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Nonsense! a man does not imagine any such thing. But what is the\n",
      "meaning of this? Harriet Smith refuse Robert Martin? madness, if it is\n",
      "so; but I hope you are mistaken.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I saw her answer!--nothing could be clearer.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You saw her answer!--you wrote her answer too. Emma, this is your\n",
      "doing. You persuaded her to refuse him.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“And if I did, (which, however, I am far from allowing) I should not\n",
      "feel that I had done wrong. Mr. Martin is a very respectable young man,\n",
      "but I cannot admit him to be Harriet's equal; and am rather surprized\n",
      "indeed that he should have ventured to address her. By your account, he\n",
      "does seem to have had some scruples. It is a pity that they were ever\n",
      "got over.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Not Harriet's equal!” exclaimed Mr. Knightley loudly and warmly; and\n",
      "with calmer asperity, added, a few moments afterwards, “No, he is\n",
      "not her equal indeed, for he is as much her superior in sense as in\n",
      "situation. Emma, your infatuation about that girl blinds you. What are\n",
      "Harriet Smith's claims, either of birth, nature or education, to any\n",
      "connexion higher than Robert Martin? She is the natural daughter of\n",
      "nobody knows whom, with probably no settled provision at all, and\n",
      "certainly no respectable relations. She is known only as parlour-boarder\n",
      "at a common school. She is not a sensible girl, nor a girl of any\n",
      "information. She has been taught nothing useful, and is too young and\n",
      "too simple to have acquired any thing herself. At her age she can have\n",
      "no experience, and with her little wit, is not very likely ever to have\n",
      "any that can avail her. She is pretty, and she is good tempered, and\n",
      "that is all. My only scruple in advising the match was on his account,\n",
      "as being beneath his deserts, and a bad connexion for him. I felt that,\n",
      "as to fortune, in all probability he might do much better; and that as\n",
      "to a rational companion or useful helpmate, he could not do worse. But I\n",
      "could not reason so to a man in love, and was willing to trust to there\n",
      "being no harm in her, to her having that sort of disposition, which, in\n",
      "good hands, like his, might be easily led aright and turn out very well.\n",
      "The advantage of the match I felt to be all on her side; and had not the\n",
      "smallest doubt (nor have I now) that there would be a general cry-out\n",
      "upon her extreme good luck. Even _your_ satisfaction I made sure of.\n",
      "It crossed my mind immediately that you would not regret your friend's\n",
      "leaving Highbury, for the sake of her being settled so well. I remember\n",
      "saying to myself, 'Even Emma, with all her partiality for Harriet, will\n",
      "think this a good match.'”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I cannot help wondering at your knowing so little of Emma as to say any\n",
      "such thing. What! think a farmer, (and with all his sense and all his\n",
      "merit Mr. Martin is nothing more,) a good match for my intimate friend!\n",
      "Not regret her leaving Highbury for the sake of marrying a man whom\n",
      "I could never admit as an acquaintance of my own! I wonder you should\n",
      "think it possible for me to have such feelings. I assure you mine are\n",
      "very different. I must think your statement by no means fair. You are\n",
      "not just to Harriet's claims. They would be estimated very differently\n",
      "by others as well as myself; Mr. Martin may be the richest of the two,\n",
      "but he is undoubtedly her inferior as to rank in society.--The sphere in\n",
      "which she moves is much above his.--It would be a degradation.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“A degradation to illegitimacy and ignorance, to be married to a\n",
      "respectable, intelligent gentleman-farmer!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“As to the circumstances of her birth, though in a legal sense she may\n",
      "be called Nobody, it will not hold in common sense. She is not to pay\n",
      "for the offence of others, by being held below the level of those with\n",
      "whom she is brought up.--There can scarcely be a doubt that her father\n",
      "is a gentleman--and a gentleman of fortune.--Her allowance is\n",
      "very liberal; nothing has ever been grudged for her improvement or\n",
      "comfort.--That she is a gentleman's daughter, is indubitable to me; that\n",
      "she associates with gentlemen's daughters, no one, I apprehend, will\n",
      "deny.--She is superior to Mr. Robert Martin.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Whoever might be her parents,” said Mr. Knightley, “whoever may have\n",
      "had the charge of her, it does not appear to have been any part of\n",
      "their plan to introduce her into what you would call good society. After\n",
      "receiving a very indifferent education she is left in Mrs. Goddard's\n",
      "hands to shift as she can;--to move, in short, in Mrs. Goddard's line,\n",
      "to have Mrs. Goddard's acquaintance. Her friends evidently thought\n",
      "this good enough for her; and it _was_ good enough. She desired nothing\n",
      "better herself. Till you chose to turn her into a friend, her mind had\n",
      "no distaste for her own set, nor any ambition beyond it. She was as\n",
      "happy as possible with the Martins in the summer. She had no sense of\n",
      "superiority then. If she has it now, you have given it. You have been no\n",
      "friend to Harriet Smith, Emma. Robert Martin would never have proceeded\n",
      "so far, if he had not felt persuaded of her not being disinclined to\n",
      "him. I know him well. He has too much real feeling to address any\n",
      "woman on the haphazard of selfish passion. And as to conceit, he is\n",
      "the farthest from it of any man I know. Depend upon it he had\n",
      "encouragement.”\n",

      "again.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You are a very warm friend to Mr. Martin; but, as I said before,\n",
      "are unjust to Harriet. Harriet's claims to marry well are not so\n",
      "contemptible as you represent them. She is not a clever girl, but she\n",
      "has better sense than you are aware of, and does not deserve to have her\n",
      "understanding spoken of so slightingly. Waiving that point, however, and\n",
      "supposing her to be, as you describe her, only pretty and good-natured,\n",
      "let me tell you, that in the degree she possesses them, they are not\n",
      "trivial recommendations to the world in general, for she is, in fact, a\n",
      "beautiful girl, and must be thought so by ninety-nine people out of an\n",
      "hundred; and till it appears that men are much more philosophic on the\n",
      "subject of beauty than they are generally supposed; till they do fall\n",
      "in love with well-informed minds instead of handsome faces, a girl, with\n",

      "Harriet and pleading his own cause, gave alarming ideas. The dread\n",
      "of such a failure after all became the prominent uneasiness; and when\n",

      "he came to Hartfield again; and when they did meet, his grave looks\n",
      "shewed that she was not forgiven. She was sorry, but could not repent.\n",

      "visibly forming themselves into as strong and steady an attachment as\n",
      "her youth and sort of mind admitted. Emma was soon perfectly satisfied\n",
      "of Mr. Martin's being no otherwise remembered, than as he furnished a\n",
      "contrast with Mr. Elton, of the utmost advantage to the latter.\n",
      "\n",
      "Her views of improving her little friend's mind, by a great deal of\n",
      "useful reading and conversation, had never yet led to more than a few\n",
      "first chapters, and the intention of going on to-morrow. It was much\n",
      "easier to chat than to study; much pleasanter to let her imagination\n",
      "range and work at Harriet's fortune, than to be labouring to enlarge\n",
      "her comprehension or exercise it on sober facts; and the only literary\n",
      "pursuit which engaged Harriet at present, the only mental provision she\n",
      "was making for the evening of life, was the collecting and transcribing\n",
      "all the riddles of every sort that she could meet with, into a thin\n",

      "ciphers and trophies.\n",
      "\n",
      "In this age of literature, such collections on a very grand scale are\n",
      "not uncommon. Miss Nash, head-teacher at Mrs. Goddard's, had written out\n",

      "from her, hoped, with Miss Woodhouse's help, to get a great many more.\n",
      "Emma assisted with her invention, memory and taste; and as Harriet wrote\n",
      "a very pretty hand, it was likely to be an arrangement of the first\n",
      "order, in form as well as quantity.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Woodhouse was almost as much interested in the business as the\n",

      "in. “So many clever riddles as there used to be when he was young--he\n",

      "\n",
      "His good friend Perry, too, whom he had spoken to on the subject,\n",
      "did not at present recollect any thing of the riddle kind; but he\n",

      "something, he thought, might come from that quarter.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was by no means his daughter's wish that the intellects of Highbury\n",
      "in general should be put under requisition. Mr. Elton was the only one\n",
      "whose assistance she asked. He was invited to contribute any really good\n",
      "enigmas, charades, or conundrums that he might recollect; and she had\n",
      "the pleasure of seeing him most intently at work with his recollections;\n",
      "and at the same time, as she could perceive, most earnestly careful that\n",
      "nothing ungallant, nothing that did not breathe a compliment to the\n",
      "sex should pass his lips. They owed to him their two or three politest\n",
      "puzzles; and the joy and exultation with which at last he recalled, and\n",

      "Elton. A few inferior dwellings were first to be passed, and then, about\n",
      "a quarter of a mile down the lane rose the Vicarage, an old and not\n",
      "very good house, almost as close to the road as it could be. It had\n",
      "no advantage of situation; but had been very much smartened up by the\n",
      "present proprietor; and, such as it was, there could be no possibility\n",
      "of the two friends passing it without a slackened pace and observing\n",

      "“I do not often walk this way _now_,” said Emma, as they proceeded, “but\n",
      "_then_ there will be an inducement, and I shall gradually get intimately\n",

      "not been there two minutes when she found that Harriet's habits of\n",
      "dependence and imitation were bringing her up too, and that, in short,\n",
      "they would both be soon after her. This would not do; she immediately\n",
      "stopped, under pretence of having some alteration to make in the lacing\n",
      "of her half-boot, and stooping down in complete occupation of the\n",

      "broth from Hartfield. To walk by the side of this child, and talk to\n",
      "and question her, was the most natural thing in the world, or would have\n",
      "been the most natural, had she been acting just then without design;\n",
      "and by this means the others were still able to keep ahead, without\n",
      "any obligation of waiting for her. She gained on them, however,\n",
      "involuntarily: the child's pace was quick, and theirs rather slow;\n",
      "and she was the more concerned at it, from their being evidently in\n",
      "a conversation which interested them. Mr. Elton was speaking with\n",
      "animation, Harriet listening with a very pleased attention; and Emma,\n",
      "having sent the child on, was beginning to think how she might draw back\n",

      "them.\n",

      "fall behind to arrange it once more. She then broke the lace off short,\n",
      "and dexterously throwing it into a ditch, was presently obliged to\n",
      "entreat them to stop, and acknowledged her inability to put herself to\n",

      "taken into was the one he chiefly occupied, and looking forwards; behind\n",
      "it was another with which it immediately communicated; the door between\n",
      "them was open, and Emma passed into it with the housekeeper to receive\n",
      "her assistance in the most comfortable manner. She was obliged to leave\n",

      "by engaging the housekeeper in incessant conversation, she hoped to make\n",
      "it practicable for him to chuse his own subject in the adjoining\n",

      "He had been most agreeable, most delightful; he had told Harriet that\n",

      "\n",
      "Mr. Elton must now be left to himself. It was no longer in Emma's power\n",
      "to superintend his happiness or quicken his measures. The coming of her\n",
      "sister's family was so very near at hand, that first in anticipation,\n",
      "and then in reality, it became henceforth her prime object of interest;\n",
      "and during the ten days of their stay at Hartfield it was not to be\n",
      "expected--she did not herself expect--that any thing beyond occasional,\n",
      "fortuitous assistance could be afforded by her to the lovers. They might\n",
      "advance rapidly if they would, however; they must advance somehow or\n",
      "other whether they would or no. She hardly wished to have more leisure\n",
      "for them. There are people, who the more you do for them, the less they\n",
      "will do for themselves.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. and Mrs. John Knightley, from having been longer than usual absent\n",
      "from Surry, were exciting of course rather more than the usual interest.\n",
      "Till this year, every long vacation since their marriage had been\n",
      "divided between Hartfield and Donwell Abbey; but all the holidays of\n",
      "this autumn had been given to sea-bathing for the children, and it was\n",
      "therefore many months since they had been seen in a regular way by their\n",
      "Surry connexions, or seen at all by Mr. Woodhouse, who could not be\n",
      "induced to get so far as London, even for poor Isabella's sake; and\n",
      "who consequently was now most nervously and apprehensively happy in\n",
      "forestalling this too short visit.\n",
      "\n",
      "He thought much of the evils of the journey for her, and not a little\n",
      "of the fatigues of his own horses and coachman who were to bring some\n",
      "of the party the last half of the way; but his alarms were needless;\n",
      "the sixteen miles being happily accomplished, and Mr. and Mrs. John\n",
      "Knightley, their five children, and a competent number of nursery-maids,\n",
      "all reaching Hartfield in safety. The bustle and joy of such an arrival,\n",
      "the many to be talked to, welcomed, encouraged, and variously dispersed\n",
      "and disposed of, produced a noise and confusion which his nerves could\n",
      "not have borne under any other cause, nor have endured much longer even\n",
      "for this; but the ways of Hartfield and the feelings of her father\n",
      "were so respected by Mrs. John Knightley, that in spite of maternal\n",
      "solicitude for the immediate enjoyment of her little ones, and for their\n",
      "having instantly all the liberty and attendance, all the eating and\n",
      "drinking, and sleeping and playing, which they could possibly wish for,\n",
      "without the smallest delay, the children were never allowed to be long\n",
      "a disturbance to him, either in themselves or in any restless attendance\n",
      "on them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. John Knightley was a pretty, elegant little woman, of gentle, quiet\n",
      "manners, and a disposition remarkably amiable and affectionate; wrapt\n",
      "up in her family; a devoted wife, a doating mother, and so tenderly\n",
      "attached to her father and sister that, but for these higher ties, a\n",
      "warmer love might have seemed impossible. She could never see a fault\n",
      "in any of them. She was not a woman of strong understanding or any\n",
      "quickness; and with this resemblance of her father, she inherited also\n",
      "much of his constitution; was delicate in her own health, over-careful\n",
      "of that of her children, had many fears and many nerves, and was as fond\n",
      "of her own Mr. Wingfield in town as her father could be of Mr. Perry.\n",
      "They were alike too, in a general benevolence of temper, and a strong\n",
      "habit of regard for every old acquaintance.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. John Knightley was a tall, gentleman-like, and very clever man;\n",
      "rising in his profession, domestic, and respectable in his private\n",
      "character; but with reserved manners which prevented his being generally\n",
      "pleasing; and capable of being sometimes out of humour. He was not an\n",
      "ill-tempered man, not so often unreasonably cross as to deserve such a\n",
      "reproach; but his temper was not his great perfection; and, indeed, with\n",
      "such a worshipping wife, it was hardly possible that any natural defects\n",
      "in it should not be increased. The extreme sweetness of her temper\n",
      "must hurt his. He had all the clearness and quickness of mind which she\n",
      "wanted, and he could sometimes act an ungracious, or say a severe thing.\n",
      "\n",
      "He was not a great favourite with his fair sister-in-law. Nothing wrong\n",
      "in him escaped her. She was quick in feeling the little injuries to\n",
      "Isabella, which Isabella never felt herself. Perhaps she might have\n",
      "passed over more had his manners been flattering to Isabella's sister,\n",
      "but they were only those of a calmly kind brother and friend, without\n",
      "praise and without blindness; but hardly any degree of personal\n",
      "compliment could have made her regardless of that greatest fault of\n",
      "all in her eyes which he sometimes fell into, the want of respectful\n",
      "forbearance towards her father. There he had not always the patience\n",
      "that could have been wished. Mr. Woodhouse's peculiarities and\n",
      "fidgetiness were sometimes provoking him to a rational remonstrance or\n",
      "sharp retort equally ill-bestowed. It did not often happen; for Mr. John\n",
      "Knightley had really a great regard for his father-in-law, and generally\n",
      "a strong sense of what was due to him; but it was too often for Emma's\n",
      "charity, especially as there was all the pain of apprehension frequently\n",
      "to be endured, though the offence came not. The beginning, however, of\n",
      "every visit displayed none but the properest feelings, and this being of\n",
      "necessity so short might be hoped to pass away in unsullied cordiality.\n",
      "They had not been long seated and composed when Mr. Woodhouse, with a\n",
      "melancholy shake of the head and a sigh, called his daughter's attention\n",
      "to the sad change at Hartfield since she had been there last.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ah, my dear,” said he, “poor Miss Taylor--It is a grievous business.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh yes, sir,” cried she with ready sympathy, “how you must miss her!\n",
      "And dear Emma, too!--What a dreadful loss to you both!--I have been so\n",
      "grieved for you.--I could not imagine how you could possibly do without\n",
      "her.--It is a sad change indeed.--But I hope she is pretty well, sir.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Pretty well, my dear--I hope--pretty well.--I do not know but that the\n",
      "place agrees with her tolerably.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. John Knightley here asked Emma quietly whether there were any doubts\n",
      "of the air of Randalls.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh! no--none in the least. I never saw Mrs. Weston better in my\n",
      "life--never looking so well. Papa is only speaking his own regret.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Very much to the honour of both,” was the handsome reply.\n",
      "\n",
      "“And do you see her, sir, tolerably often?” asked Isabella in the\n",
      "plaintive tone which just suited her father.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Woodhouse hesitated.--“Not near so often, my dear, as I could wish.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh! papa, we have missed seeing them but one entire day since they\n",
      "married. Either in the morning or evening of every day, excepting one,\n",
      "have we seen either Mr. Weston or Mrs. Weston, and generally both,\n",
      "either at Randalls or here--and as you may suppose, Isabella, most\n",
      "frequently here. They are very, very kind in their visits. Mr. Weston\n",
      "is really as kind as herself. Papa, if you speak in that melancholy way,\n",
      "you will be giving Isabella a false idea of us all. Every body must be\n",
      "aware that Miss Taylor must be missed, but every body ought also to be\n",
      "assured that Mr. and Mrs. Weston do really prevent our missing her by\n",
      "any means to the extent we ourselves anticipated--which is the exact\n",
      "truth.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Just as it should be,” said Mr. John Knightley, “and just as I hoped\n",
      "it was from your letters. Her wish of shewing you attention could not be\n",
      "doubted, and his being a disengaged and social man makes it all easy. I\n",
      "have been always telling you, my love, that I had no idea of the change\n",
      "being so very material to Hartfield as you apprehended; and now you have\n",
      "Emma's account, I hope you will be satisfied.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why, to be sure,” said Mr. Woodhouse--“yes, certainly--I cannot\n",
      "deny that Mrs. Weston, poor Mrs. Weston, does come and see us pretty\n",
      "often--but then--she is always obliged to go away again.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It would be very hard upon Mr. Weston if she did not, papa.--You quite\n",
      "forget poor Mr. Weston.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I think, indeed,” said John Knightley pleasantly, “that Mr. Weston has\n",
      "some little claim. You and I, Emma, will venture to take the part of the\n",
      "poor husband. I, being a husband, and you not being a wife, the claims\n",
      "of the man may very likely strike us with equal force. As for Isabella,\n",
      "she has been married long enough to see the convenience of putting all\n",
      "the Mr. Westons aside as much as she can.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Me, my love,” cried his wife, hearing and understanding only in part.--\n",
      "“Are you talking about me?--I am sure nobody ought to be, or can be, a\n",
      "greater advocate for matrimony than I am; and if it had not been for\n",
      "the misery of her leaving Hartfield, I should never have thought of Miss\n",
      "Taylor but as the most fortunate woman in the world; and as to slighting\n",
      "Mr. Weston, that excellent Mr. Weston, I think there is nothing he does\n",
      "not deserve. I believe he is one of the very best-tempered men that ever\n",
      "existed. Excepting yourself and your brother, I do not know his equal\n",
      "for temper. I shall never forget his flying Henry's kite for him that\n",
      "very windy day last Easter--and ever since his particular kindness last\n",
      "September twelvemonth in writing that note, at twelve o'clock at night,\n",
      "on purpose to assure me that there was no scarlet fever at Cobham, I\n",
      "have been convinced there could not be a more feeling heart nor a better\n",
      "man in existence.--If any body can deserve him, it must be Miss Taylor.”\n",

      "“Where is the young man?” said John Knightley. “Has he been here on this\n",
      "occasion--or has he not?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“He has not been here yet,” replied Emma. “There was a strong\n",
      "expectation of his coming soon after the marriage, but it ended in\n",
      "nothing; and I have not heard him mentioned lately.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But you should tell them of the letter, my dear,” said her father.\n",
      "“He wrote a letter to poor Mrs. Weston, to congratulate her, and a very\n",
      "proper, handsome letter it was. She shewed it to me. I thought it very\n",
      "well done of him indeed. Whether it was his own idea you know, one\n",
      "cannot tell. He is but young, and his uncle, perhaps--”\n",

      "friendship, that when he came into the room she had one of the children\n",
      "with her--the youngest, a nice little girl about eight months old, who\n",
      "was now making her first visit to Hartfield, and very happy to be danced\n",
      "about in her aunt's arms. It did assist; for though he began with grave\n",

      "the usual way, and to take the child out of her arms with all the\n",

      "not time to take care of himself--he tells me he has not time to take\n",
      "care of himself--which is very sad--but he is always wanted all round\n",

      "you had better let him look at little Bella's throat.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh! my dear sir, her throat is so much better that I have hardly any\n",
      "uneasiness about it. Either bathing has been of the greatest service to\n",
      "her, or else it is to be attributed to an excellent embrocation of Mr.\n",
      "Wingfield's, which we have been applying at times ever since August.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It is not very likely, my dear, that bathing should have been of use\n",
      "to her--and if I had known you were wanting an embrocation, I would have\n",
      "spoken to--\n",

      "bad cold about a month ago.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“How sorry I am! But colds were never so prevalent as they have been\n",

      "general or heavy--except when it has been quite an influenza.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“That has been a good deal the case, my dear; but not to the degree you\n",
      "mention. Perry says that colds have been very general, but not so heavy\n",
      "as he has very often known them in November. Perry does not call it\n",
      "altogether a sickly season.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No, I do not know that Mr. Wingfield considers it _very_ sickly\n",
      "except--\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ah! my poor dear child, the truth is, that in London it is always\n",
      "a sickly season. Nobody is healthy in London, nobody can be. It is a\n",
      "dreadful thing to have you forced to live there! so far off!--and the\n",
      "air so bad!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No, indeed--_we_ are not at all in a bad air. Our part of London is\n",
      "very superior to most others!--You must not confound us with London\n",
      "in general, my dear sir. The neighbourhood of Brunswick Square is very\n",
      "different from almost all the rest. We are so very airy! I should be\n",
      "unwilling, I own, to live in any other part of the town;--there is\n",
      "hardly any other that I could be satisfied to have my children in:\n",

      "little nervous head-aches and palpitations which I am never entirely\n",
      "free from anywhere, I am quite well myself; and if the children were\n",
      "rather pale before they went to bed, it was only because they were a\n",
      "little more tired than usual, from their journey and the happiness of\n",
      "coming. I hope you will think better of their looks to-morrow; for I\n",
      "assure you Mr. Wingfield told me, that he did not believe he had ever\n",

      "\n",
      "“I am sorry to find, my love, that my father does not think you looking\n",
      "well--but I hope it is only from being a little fatigued. I could have\n",

      "And she talked in this way so long and successfully that, when forced to\n",
      "give her attention again to her father and sister, she had nothing\n",
      "worse to hear than Isabella's kind inquiry after Jane Fairfax; and Jane\n",
      "Fairfax, though no great favourite with her in general, she was at that\n",
      "moment very happy to assist in praising.\n",
      "\n",

      "grandmother and excellent aunt, when she comes to visit them! I always\n",
      "regret excessively on dear Emma's account that she cannot be more at\n",
      "Highbury; but now their daughter is married, I suppose Colonel and Mrs.\n",

      "\n",
      "“Our little friend Harriet Smith, however, is just such another pretty\n",

      "\n",
      "This topic was discussed very happily, and others succeeded of similar\n",
      "moment, and passed away with similar harmony; but the evening did not\n",
      "close without a little return of agitation. The gruel came and supplied\n",
      "a great deal to be said--much praise and many comments--undoubting\n",
      "decision of its wholesomeness for every constitution, and pretty\n",
      "severe Philippics upon the many houses where it was never met with\n",
      "tolerably;--but, unfortunately, among the failures which the daughter\n",
      "had to instance, the most recent, and therefore most prominent, was in\n",
      "her own cook at South End, a young woman hired for the time, who never\n",
      "had been able to understand what she meant by a basin of nice smooth\n",
      "gruel, thin, but not too thin. Often as she had wished for and ordered\n",
      "it, she had never been able to get any thing tolerable. Here was a\n",
      "dangerous opening.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ah!” said Mr. Woodhouse, shaking his head and fixing his eyes on her\n",
      "with tender concern.--The ejaculation in Emma's ear expressed, “Ah!\n",
      "there is no end of the sad consequences of your going to South End. It\n",
      "does not bear talking of.” And for a little while she hoped he would not\n",
      "talk of it, and that a silent rumination might suffice to restore him to\n",
      "the relish of his own smooth gruel. After an interval of some minutes,\n",
      "however, he began with,\n",

      "\n",
      "“And, moreover, if you must go to the sea, it had better not have been\n",
      "to South End. South End is an unhealthy place. Perry was surprized to\n",
      "hear you had fixed upon South End.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I know there is such an idea with many people, but indeed it is quite\n",
      "a mistake, sir.--We all had our health perfectly well there, never\n",
      "found the least inconvenience from the mud; and Mr. Wingfield says it is\n",
      "entirely a mistake to suppose the place unhealthy; and I am sure he may\n",

      "\n",
      "“You should have gone to Cromer, my dear, if you went anywhere.--Perry\n",
      "was a week at Cromer once, and he holds it to be the best of all the\n",
      "sea-bathing places. A fine open sea, he says, and very pure air. And, by\n",
      "what I understand, you might have had lodgings there quite away from\n",
      "the sea--a quarter of a mile off--very comfortable. You should have\n",
      "consulted Perry.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But, my dear sir, the difference of the journey;--only consider how\n",
      "great it would have been.--An hundred miles, perhaps, instead of forty.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ah! my dear, as Perry says, where health is at stake, nothing else\n",
      "should be considered; and if one is to travel, there is not much to\n",
      "chuse between forty miles and an hundred.--Better not move at all,\n",
      "better stay in London altogether than travel forty miles to get into\n",

      "one part of the coast or another?--I may be allowed, I hope, the use of\n",
      "my judgment as well as Mr. Perry.--I want his directions no more than\n",

      "among her old acquaintance with her five children, and talking over what\n",
      "she had done every evening with her father and sister. She had nothing\n",
      "to wish otherwise, but that the days did not pass so swiftly. It was a\n",
      "delightful visit;--perfect, in being much too short.\n",
      "\n",
      "In general their evenings were less engaged with friends than their\n",
      "mornings; but one complete dinner engagement, and out of the house too,\n",
      "there was no avoiding, though at Christmas. Mr. Weston would take no\n",
      "denial; they must all dine at Randalls one day;--even Mr. Woodhouse was\n",
      "persuaded to think it a possible thing in preference to a division of\n",
      "the party.\n",
      "\n",
      "How they were all to be conveyed, he would have made a difficulty if he\n",
      "could, but as his son and daughter's carriage and horses were actually\n",
      "at Hartfield, he was not able to make more than a simple question on\n",
      "that head; it hardly amounted to a doubt; nor did it occupy Emma long\n",
      "to convince him that they might in one of the carriages find room for\n",
      "Harriet also.\n",
      "\n",
      "Harriet, Mr. Elton, and Mr. Knightley, their own especial set, were the\n",
      "only persons invited to meet them;--the hours were to be early, as\n",
      "well as the numbers few; Mr. Woodhouse's habits and inclination being\n",
      "consulted in every thing.\n",
      "\n",
      "The evening before this great event (for it was a very great event that\n",
      "Mr. Woodhouse should dine out, on the 24th of December) had been spent\n",
      "by Harriet at Hartfield, and she had gone home so much indisposed with\n",
      "a cold, that, but for her own earnest wish of being nursed by Mrs.\n",
      "Goddard, Emma could not have allowed her to leave the house. Emma called\n",
      "on her the next day, and found her doom already signed with regard to\n",
      "Randalls. She was very feverish and had a bad sore throat: Mrs. Goddard\n",
      "was full of care and affection, Mr. Perry was talked of, and Harriet\n",
      "herself was too ill and low to resist the authority which excluded her\n",

      "tolerably comfortable, in the sweet dependence of his having a most\n",
      "comfortless visit, and of their all missing her very much. She had not\n",
      "advanced many yards from Mrs. Goddard's door, when she was met by Mr.\n",
      "Elton himself, evidently coming towards it, and as they walked on slowly\n",
      "together in conversation about the invalid--of whom he, on the rumour\n",
      "of considerable illness, had been going to inquire, that he might\n",
      "carry some report of her to Hartfield--they were overtaken by Mr. John\n",
      "Knightley returning from the daily visit to Donwell, with his two eldest\n",

      "run, and seemed to ensure a quick despatch of the roast mutton and rice\n",
      "pudding they were hastening home for. They joined company and\n",
      "proceeded together. Emma was just describing the nature of her friend's\n",
      "complaint;--“a throat very much inflamed, with a great deal of heat\n",
      "about her, a quick, low pulse, &c. and she was sorry to find from Mrs.\n",
      "Goddard that Harriet was liable to very bad sore-throats, and had often\n",
      "alarmed her with them.” Mr. Elton looked all alarm on the occasion, as\n",
      "he exclaimed,\n",
      "\n",
      "“A sore-throat!--I hope not infectious. I hope not of a putrid\n",
      "infectious sort. Has Perry seen her? Indeed you should take care of\n",

      "Why does not Perry see her?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Emma, who was not really at all frightened herself, tranquillised this\n",
      "excess of apprehension by assurances of Mrs. Goddard's experience and\n",
      "care; but as there must still remain a degree of uneasiness which she\n",
      "could not wish to reason away, which she would rather feed and assist\n",
      "than not, she added soon afterwards--as if quite another subject,\n",
      "\n",
      "“It is so cold, so very cold--and looks and feels so very much like\n",
      "snow, that if it were to any other place or with any other party, I\n",
      "should really try not to go out to-day--and dissuade my father from\n",
      "venturing; but as he has made up his mind, and does not seem to feel the\n",
      "cold himself, I do not like to interfere, as I know it would be so great\n",
      "a disappointment to Mr. and Mrs. Weston. But, upon my word, Mr. Elton,\n",
      "in your case, I should certainly excuse myself. You appear to me a\n",
      "little hoarse already, and when you consider what demand of voice and\n",
      "what fatigues to-morrow will bring, I think it would be no more than\n",
      "common prudence to stay at home and take care of yourself to-night.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Elton looked as if he did not very well know what answer to make;\n",
      "which was exactly the case; for though very much gratified by the kind\n",
      "care of such a fair lady, and not liking to resist any advice of her's,\n",
      "he had not really the least inclination to give up the visit;--but Emma,\n",
      "too eager and busy in her own previous conceptions and views to hear him\n",
      "impartially, or see him with clear vision, was very well satisfied with\n",
      "his muttering acknowledgment of its being “very cold, certainly very\n",
      "cold,” and walked on, rejoicing in having extricated him from Randalls,\n",
      "and secured him the power of sending to inquire after Harriet every hour\n",
      "of the evening.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You do quite right,” said she;--“we will make your apologies to Mr. and\n",
      "Mrs. Weston.”\n",
      "\n",
      "But hardly had she so spoken, when she found her brother was civilly\n",
      "offering a seat in his carriage, if the weather were Mr. Elton's only\n",
      "objection, and Mr. Elton actually accepting the offer with much prompt\n",
      "satisfaction. It was a done thing; Mr. Elton was to go, and never had\n",
      "his broad handsome face expressed more pleasure than at this moment;\n",
      "never had his smile been stronger, nor his eyes more exulting than when\n",
      "he next looked at her.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well,” said she to herself, “this is most strange!--After I had got\n",
      "him off so well, to chuse to go into company, and leave Harriet ill\n",
      "behind!--Most strange indeed!--But there is, I believe, in many men,\n",
      "especially single men, such an inclination--such a passion for dining\n",
      "out--a dinner engagement is so high in the class of their pleasures,\n",
      "their employments, their dignities, almost their duties, that any\n",
      "thing gives way to it--and this must be the case with Mr. Elton; a most\n",
      "valuable, amiable, pleasing young man undoubtedly, and very much in love\n",
      "with Harriet; but still, he cannot refuse an invitation, he must dine\n",
      "out wherever he is asked. What a strange thing love is! he can see ready\n",
      "wit in Harriet, but will not dine alone for her.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Soon afterwards Mr. Elton quitted them, and she could not but do him\n",
      "the justice of feeling that there was a great deal of sentiment in his\n",
      "manner of naming Harriet at parting; in the tone of his voice while\n",
      "assuring her that he should call at Mrs. Goddard's for news of her fair\n",
      "friend, the last thing before he prepared for the happiness of meeting\n",
      "her again, when he hoped to be able to give a better report; and\n",
      "he sighed and smiled himself off in a way that left the balance of\n",
      "approbation much in his favour.\n",
      "\n",
      "After a few minutes of entire silence between them, John Knightley began\n",
      "with--\n",
      "\n",
      "“I never in my life saw a man more intent on being agreeable than Mr.\n",
      "Elton. It is downright labour to him where ladies are concerned. With\n",
      "men he can be rational and unaffected, but when he has ladies to please,\n",
      "every feature works.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Mr. Elton's manners are not perfect,” replied Emma; “but where there is\n",
      "a wish to please, one ought to overlook, and one does overlook a great\n",
      "deal. Where a man does his best with only moderate powers, he will\n",
      "have the advantage over negligent superiority. There is such perfect\n",
      "good-temper and good-will in Mr. Elton as one cannot but value.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes,” said Mr. John Knightley presently, with some slyness, “he seems\n",
      "to have a great deal of good-will towards you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Me!” she replied with a smile of astonishment, “are you imagining me to\n",
      "be Mr. Elton's object?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Such an imagination has crossed me, I own, Emma; and if it never\n",
      "occurred to you before, you may as well take it into consideration now.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Mr. Elton in love with me!--What an idea!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I do not say it is so; but you will do well to consider whether it\n",
      "is so or not, and to regulate your behaviour accordingly. I think your\n",
      "manners to him encouraging. I speak as a friend, Emma. You had better\n",
      "look about you, and ascertain what you do, and what you mean to do.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I thank you; but I assure you you are quite mistaken. Mr. Elton and\n",
      "I are very good friends, and nothing more;” and she walked on, amusing\n",
      "herself in the consideration of the blunders which often arise from a\n",
      "partial knowledge of circumstances, of the mistakes which people of high\n",
      "pretensions to judgment are for ever falling into; and not very well\n",
      "pleased with her brother for imagining her blind and ignorant, and in\n",
      "want of counsel. He said no more.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Woodhouse had so completely made up his mind to the visit, that in\n",
      "spite of the increasing coldness, he seemed to have no idea of shrinking\n",
      "from it, and set forward at last most punctually with his eldest\n",
      "daughter in his own carriage, with less apparent consciousness of the\n",
      "weather than either of the others; too full of the wonder of his own\n",
      "going, and the pleasure it was to afford at Randalls to see that it was\n",
      "cold, and too well wrapt up to feel it. The cold, however, was severe;\n",
      "and by the time the second carriage was in motion, a few flakes of snow\n",
      "were finding their way down, and the sky had the appearance of being so\n",
      "overcharged as to want only a milder air to produce a very white world\n",
      "in a very short time.\n",
      "\n",
      "Emma soon saw that her companion was not in the happiest humour. The\n",
      "preparing and the going abroad in such weather, with the sacrifice of\n",
      "his children after dinner, were evils, were disagreeables at least,\n",
      "which Mr. John Knightley did not by any means like; he anticipated\n",
      "nothing in the visit that could be at all worth the purchase; and the\n",
      "whole of their drive to the vicarage was spent by him in expressing his\n",
      "discontent.\n",
      "\n",
      "“A man,” said he, “must have a very good opinion of himself when he asks\n",
      "people to leave their own fireside, and encounter such a day as\n",
      "this, for the sake of coming to see him. He must think himself a most\n",
      "agreeable fellow; I could not do such a thing. It is the greatest\n",
      "absurdity--Actually snowing at this moment!--The folly of not allowing\n",
      "people to be comfortable at home--and the folly of people's not staying\n",
      "comfortably at home when they can! If we were obliged to go out such\n",
      "an evening as this, by any call of duty or business, what a hardship we\n",
      "should deem it;--and here are we, probably with rather thinner clothing\n",
      "than usual, setting forward voluntarily, without excuse, in defiance of\n",
      "the voice of nature, which tells man, in every thing given to his view\n",
      "or his feelings, to stay at home himself, and keep all under shelter\n",
      "that he can;--here are we setting forward to spend five dull hours in\n",
      "another man's house, with nothing to say or to hear that was not said\n",
      "and heard yesterday, and may not be said and heard again to-morrow.\n",
      "Going in dismal weather, to return probably in worse;--four horses and\n",
      "four servants taken out for nothing but to convey five idle, shivering\n",
      "creatures into colder rooms and worse company than they might have had\n",
      "at home.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Emma did not find herself equal to give the pleased assent, which no\n",
      "doubt he was in the habit of receiving, to emulate the “Very true,\n",
      "my love,” which must have been usually administered by his travelling\n",
      "companion; but she had resolution enough to refrain from making\n",
      "any answer at all. She could not be complying, she dreaded being\n",
      "quarrelsome; her heroism reached only to silence. She allowed him to\n",
      "talk, and arranged the glasses, and wrapped herself up, without opening\n",
      "her lips.\n",
      "\n",
      "They arrived, the carriage turned, the step was let down, and Mr. Elton,\n",
      "spruce, black, and smiling, was with them instantly. Emma thought with\n",
      "pleasure of some change of subject. Mr. Elton was all obligation and\n",
      "cheerfulness; he was so very cheerful in his civilities indeed, that she\n",
      "began to think he must have received a different account of Harriet from\n",
      "what had reached her. She had sent while dressing, and the answer had\n",
      "been, “Much the same--not better.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“_My_ report from Mrs. Goddard's,” said she presently, “was not so\n",
      "pleasant as I had hoped--'Not better' was _my_ answer.”\n",
      "\n",
      "His face lengthened immediately; and his voice was the voice of\n",
      "sentiment as he answered.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh! no--I am grieved to find--I was on the point of telling you that\n",
      "when I called at Mrs. Goddard's door, which I did the very last thing\n",
      "before I returned to dress, I was told that Miss Smith was not better,\n",
      "by no means better, rather worse. Very much grieved and concerned--I\n",
      "had flattered myself that she must be better after such a cordial as I\n",
      "knew had been given her in the morning.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Emma smiled and answered--“My visit was of use to the nervous part of\n",
      "her complaint, I hope; but not even I can charm away a sore throat;\n",
      "it is a most severe cold indeed. Mr. Perry has been with her, as you\n",
      "probably heard.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes--I imagined--that is--I did not--”\n",
      "\n",
      "“He has been used to her in these complaints, and I hope to-morrow\n",
      "morning will bring us both a more comfortable report. But it is\n",
      "impossible not to feel uneasiness. Such a sad loss to our party to-day!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Dreadful!--Exactly so, indeed.--She will be missed every moment.”\n",
      "\n",
      "This was very proper; the sigh which accompanied it was really\n",
      "estimable; but it should have lasted longer. Emma was rather in dismay\n",
      "when only half a minute afterwards he began to speak of other things,\n",
      "and in a voice of the greatest alacrity and enjoyment.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What an excellent device,” said he, “the use of a sheepskin for\n",
      "carriages. How very comfortable they make it;--impossible to feel cold\n",
      "with such precautions. The contrivances of modern days indeed have\n",
      "rendered a gentleman's carriage perfectly complete. One is so fenced\n",
      "and guarded from the weather, that not a breath of air can find its way\n",
      "unpermitted. Weather becomes absolutely of no consequence. It is a very\n",
      "cold afternoon--but in this carriage we know nothing of the matter.--Ha!\n",
      "snows a little I see.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes,” said John Knightley, “and I think we shall have a good deal of\n",
      "it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Christmas weather,” observed Mr. Elton. “Quite seasonable; and\n",
      "extremely fortunate we may think ourselves that it did not begin\n",
      "yesterday, and prevent this day's party, which it might very possibly\n",
      "have done, for Mr. Woodhouse would hardly have ventured had there been\n",
      "much snow on the ground; but now it is of no consequence. This is quite\n",
      "the season indeed for friendly meetings. At Christmas every body invites\n",
      "their friends about them, and people think little of even the worst\n",
      "weather. I was snowed up at a friend's house once for a week. Nothing\n",
      "could be pleasanter. I went for only one night, and could not get away\n",
      "till that very day se'nnight.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. John Knightley looked as if he did not comprehend the pleasure, but\n",
      "said only, coolly,\n",
      "\n",
      "“I cannot wish to be snowed up a week at Randalls.”\n",
      "\n",
      "At another time Emma might have been amused, but she was too much\n",
      "astonished now at Mr. Elton's spirits for other feelings. Harriet seemed\n",
      "quite forgotten in the expectation of a pleasant party.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We are sure of excellent fires,” continued he, “and every thing in the\n",
      "greatest comfort. Charming people, Mr. and Mrs. Weston;--Mrs. Weston\n",
      "indeed is much beyond praise, and he is exactly what one values, so\n",
      "hospitable, and so fond of society;--it will be a small party, but where\n",
      "small parties are select, they are perhaps the most agreeable of any.\n",
      "Mr. Weston's dining-room does not accommodate more than ten comfortably;\n",
      "and for my part, I would rather, under such circumstances, fall short by\n",
      "two than exceed by two. I think you will agree with me, (turning with\n",
      "a soft air to Emma,) I think I shall certainly have your approbation,\n",
      "though Mr. Knightley perhaps, from being used to the large parties of\n",
      "London, may not quite enter into our feelings.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I know nothing of the large parties of London, sir--I never dine with\n",
      "any body.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Indeed! (in a tone of wonder and pity,) I had no idea that the law had\n",
      "been so great a slavery. Well, sir, the time must come when you will\n",
      "be paid for all this, when you will have little labour and great\n",
      "enjoyment.”\n",

      "joyous looks, and Mr. John Knightley disperse his ill-humour. Mr.\n",
      "Elton must smile less, and Mr. John Knightley more, to fit them for the\n",
      "place.--Emma only might be as nature prompted, and shew herself just as\n",
      "happy as she was. To her it was real enjoyment to be with the Westons.\n",
      "Mr. Weston was a great favourite, and there was not a creature in the\n",
      "world to whom she spoke with such unreserve, as to his wife; not any\n",
      "one, to whom she related with such conviction of being listened to and\n",
      "understood, of being always interesting and always intelligible, the\n",
      "little affairs, arrangements, perplexities, and pleasures of her father\n",
      "and herself. She could tell nothing of Hartfield, in which Mrs. Weston\n",
      "had not a lively concern; and half an hour's uninterrupted communication\n",
      "of all those little matters on which the daily happiness of private life\n",
      "depends, was one of the first gratifications of each.\n",
      "\n",
      "This was a pleasure which perhaps the whole day's visit might not\n",
      "afford, which certainly did not belong to the present half-hour; but the\n",
      "very sight of Mrs. Weston, her smile, her touch, her voice was grateful\n",
      "to Emma, and she determined to think as little as possible of Mr.\n",

      "to give the history of it, besides all the history of his own and\n",
      "Isabella's coming, and of Emma's being to follow, and had indeed just\n",
      "got to the end of his satisfaction that James should come and see his\n",
      "daughter, when the others appeared, and Mrs. Weston, who had been almost\n",
      "wholly engrossed by her attentions to him, was able to turn away and\n",
      "welcome her dear Emma.\n",
      "\n",
      "Emma's project of forgetting Mr. Elton for a while made her rather sorry\n",
      "to find, when they had all taken their places, that he was close to her.\n",
      "The difficulty was great of driving his strange insensibility towards\n",
      "Harriet, from her mind, while he not only sat at her elbow, but\n",
      "was continually obtruding his happy countenance on her notice, and\n",
      "solicitously addressing her upon every occasion. Instead of forgetting\n",
      "him, his behaviour was such that she could not avoid the internal\n",
      "suggestion of “Can it really be as my brother imagined? can it be\n",
      "possible for this man to be beginning to transfer his affections from\n",
      "Harriet to me?--Absurd and insufferable!”--Yet he would be so anxious\n",
      "for her being perfectly warm, would be so interested about her father,\n",
      "and so delighted with Mrs. Weston; and at last would begin admiring her\n",
      "drawings with so much zeal and so little knowledge as seemed terribly\n",
      "like a would-be lover, and made it some effort with her to preserve her\n",
      "good manners. For her own sake she could not be rude; and for Harriet's,\n",
      "in the hope that all would yet turn out right, she was even positively\n",
      "civil; but it was an effort; especially as something was going on\n",
      "amongst the others, in the most overpowering period of Mr. Elton's\n",
      "nonsense, which she particularly wished to listen to. She heard enough\n",
      "to know that Mr. Weston was giving some information about his son; she\n",
      "heard the words “my son,” and “Frank,” and “my son,” repeated several\n",
      "times over; and, from a few other half-syllables very much suspected\n",
      "that he was announcing an early visit from his son; but before she could\n",
      "quiet Mr. Elton, the subject was so completely past that any reviving\n",
      "question from her would have been awkward.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, it so happened that in spite of Emma's resolution of never\n",
      "marrying, there was something in the name, in the idea of Mr.\n",
      "Frank Churchill, which always interested her. She had frequently\n",
      "thought--especially since his father's marriage with Miss Taylor--that\n",
      "if she _were_ to marry, he was the very person to suit her in age,\n",
      "character and condition. He seemed by this connexion between the\n",
      "families, quite to belong to her. She could not but suppose it to be\n",
      "a match that every body who knew them must think of. That Mr. and Mrs.\n",
      "Weston did think of it, she was very strongly persuaded; and though\n",
      "not meaning to be induced by him, or by any body else, to give up a\n",
      "situation which she believed more replete with good than any she could\n",
      "change it for, she had a great curiosity to see him, a decided intention\n",
      "of finding him pleasant, of being liked by him to a certain degree, and\n",
      "a sort of pleasure in the idea of their being coupled in their friends'\n",
      "imaginations.\n",
      "\n",
      "With such sensations, Mr. Elton's civilities were dreadfully ill-timed;\n",
      "but she had the comfort of appearing very polite, while feeling very\n",
      "cross--and of thinking that the rest of the visit could not possibly\n",
      "pass without bringing forward the same information again, or the\n",
      "substance of it, from the open-hearted Mr. Weston.--So it proved;--for\n",
      "when happily released from Mr. Elton, and seated by Mr. Weston,\n",
      "at dinner, he made use of the very first interval in the cares of\n",
      "hospitality, the very first leisure from the saddle of mutton, to say to\n",
      "her,\n",
      "\n",
      "“We want only two more to be just the right number. I should like to see\n",
      "two more here,--your pretty little friend, Miss Smith, and my son--and\n",
      "then I should say we were quite complete. I believe you did not hear me\n",
      "telling the others in the drawing-room that we are expecting Frank.\n",
      "I had a letter from him this morning, and he will be with us within a\n",
      "fortnight.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Emma spoke with a very proper degree of pleasure; and fully assented to\n",
      "his proposition of Mr. Frank Churchill and Miss Smith making their party\n",
      "quite complete.\n",
      "\n",
      "“He has been wanting to come to us,” continued Mr. Weston, “ever since\n",
      "September: every letter has been full of it; but he cannot command his\n",
      "own time. He has those to please who must be pleased, and who (between\n",
      "ourselves) are sometimes to be pleased only by a good many sacrifices.\n",
      "But now I have no doubt of seeing him here about the second week in\n",
      "January.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“What a very great pleasure it will be to you! and Mrs. Weston is so\n",

      "\n",
      "“Yes, she would be, but that she thinks there will be another put-off.\n",
      "She does not depend upon his coming so much as I do: but she does not\n",
      "know the parties so well as I do. The case, you see, is--(but this is\n",
      "quite between ourselves: I did not mention a syllable of it in the other\n",
      "room. There are secrets in all families, you know)--The case is, that a\n",
      "party of friends are invited to pay a visit at Enscombe in January; and\n",
      "that Frank's coming depends upon their being put off. If they are not\n",
      "put off, he cannot stir. But I know they will, because it is a family\n",
      "that a certain lady, of some consequence, at Enscombe, has a particular\n",
      "dislike to: and though it is thought necessary to invite them once in\n",
      "two or three years, they always are put off when it comes to the point.\n",
      "I have not the smallest doubt of the issue. I am as confident of seeing\n",
      "Frank here before the middle of January, as I am of being here myself:\n",
      "but your good friend there (nodding towards the upper end of the table)\n",
      "has so few vagaries herself, and has been so little used to them at\n",
      "Hartfield, that she cannot calculate on their effects, as I have been\n",
      "long in the practice of doing.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I am sorry there should be any thing like doubt in the case,” replied\n",
      "Emma; “but am disposed to side with you, Mr. Weston. If you think he\n",
      "will come, I shall think so too; for you know Enscombe.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes--I have some right to that knowledge; though I have never been at\n",
      "the place in my life.--She is an odd woman!--But I never allow myself\n",
      "to speak ill of her, on Frank's account; for I do believe her to be very\n",
      "fond of him. I used to think she was not capable of being fond of\n",
      "any body, except herself: but she has always been kind to him (in her\n",
      "way--allowing for little whims and caprices, and expecting every thing\n",
      "to be as she likes). And it is no small credit, in my opinion, to him,\n",
      "that he should excite such an affection; for, though I would not say\n",
      "it to any body else, she has no more heart than a stone to people in\n",
      "general; and the devil of a temper.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Emma liked the subject so well, that she began upon it, to Mrs. Weston,\n",
      "very soon after their moving into the drawing-room: wishing her joy--yet\n",
      "observing, that she knew the first meeting must be rather alarming.--\n",
      "Mrs. Weston agreed to it; but added, that she should be very glad to be\n",
      "secure of undergoing the anxiety of a first meeting at the time talked\n",
      "of: “for I cannot depend upon his coming. I cannot be so sanguine as\n",
      "Mr. Weston. I am very much afraid that it will all end in nothing. Mr.\n",
      "Weston, I dare say, has been telling you exactly how the matter stands?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes--it seems to depend upon nothing but the ill-humour of Mrs.\n",
      "Churchill, which I imagine to be the most certain thing in the world.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“My Emma!” replied Mrs. Weston, smiling, “what is the certainty\n",
      "of caprice?” Then turning to Isabella, who had not been attending\n",
      "before--“You must know, my dear Mrs. Knightley, that we are by no means\n",
      "so sure of seeing Mr. Frank Churchill, in my opinion, as his father\n",
      "thinks. It depends entirely upon his aunt's spirits and pleasure; in\n",
      "short, upon her temper. To you--to my two daughters--I may venture on\n",
      "the truth. Mrs. Churchill rules at Enscombe, and is a very odd-tempered\n",
      "woman; and his coming now, depends upon her being willing to spare him.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, Mrs. Churchill; every body knows Mrs. Churchill,” replied Isabella:\n",
      "“and I am sure I never think of that poor young man without the greatest\n",
      "compassion. To be constantly living with an ill-tempered person, must\n",
      "be dreadful. It is what we happily have never known any thing of; but\n",
      "it must be a life of misery. What a blessing, that she never had any\n",
      "children! Poor little creatures, how unhappy she would have made them!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Emma wished she had been alone with Mrs. Weston. She should then have\n",
      "heard more: Mrs. Weston would speak to her, with a degree of unreserve\n",
      "which she would not hazard with Isabella; and, she really believed,\n",
      "would scarcely try to conceal any thing relative to the Churchills\n",
      "from her, excepting those views on the young man, of which her own\n",
      "imagination had already given her such instinctive knowledge. But at\n",
      "present there was nothing more to be said. Mr. Woodhouse very soon\n",
      "followed them into the drawing-room. To be sitting long after\n",
      "dinner, was a confinement that he could not endure. Neither wine nor\n",
      "conversation was any thing to him; and gladly did he move to those with\n",
      "whom he was always comfortable.\n",
      "\n",
      "While he talked to Isabella, however, Emma found an opportunity of\n",
      "saying,\n",
      "\n",
      "“And so you do not consider this visit from your son as by any means\n",
      "certain. I am sorry for it. The introduction must be unpleasant,\n",
      "whenever it takes place; and the sooner it could be over, the better.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes; and every delay makes one more apprehensive of other delays. Even\n",
      "if this family, the Braithwaites, are put off, I am still afraid that\n",
      "some excuse may be found for disappointing us. I cannot bear to imagine\n",
      "any reluctance on his side; but I am sure there is a great wish on\n",
      "the Churchills' to keep him to themselves. There is jealousy. They\n",
      "are jealous even of his regard for his father. In short, I can feel no\n",
      "dependence on his coming, and I wish Mr. Weston were less sanguine.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“He ought to come,” said Emma. “If he could stay only a couple of days,\n",
      "he ought to come; and one can hardly conceive a young man's not having\n",
      "it in his power to do as much as that. A young _woman_, if she fall into\n",
      "bad hands, may be teased, and kept at a distance from those she wants\n",
      "to be with; but one cannot comprehend a young _man_'s being under such\n",
      "restraint, as not to be able to spend a week with his father, if he\n",
      "likes it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“One ought to be at Enscombe, and know the ways of the family, before\n",
      "one decides upon what he can do,” replied Mrs. Weston. “One ought to\n",
      "use the same caution, perhaps, in judging of the conduct of any one\n",
      "individual of any one family; but Enscombe, I believe, certainly must\n",
      "not be judged by general rules: _she_ is so very unreasonable; and every\n",
      "thing gives way to her.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But she is so fond of the nephew: he is so very great a favourite. Now,\n",

      "while she makes no sacrifice for the comfort of the husband, to whom she\n",
      "owes every thing, while she exercises incessant caprice towards _him_,\n",

      "be.”\n",

      "Mr. Woodhouse was soon ready for his tea; and when he had drank his\n",
      "tea he was quite ready to go home; and it was as much as his three\n",
      "companions could do, to entertain away his notice of the lateness of\n",
      "the hour, before the other gentlemen appeared. Mr. Weston was chatty and\n",
      "convivial, and no friend to early separations of any sort; but at last\n",
      "the drawing-room party did receive an augmentation. Mr. Elton, in very\n",
      "good spirits, was one of the first to walk in. Mrs. Weston and Emma\n",
      "were sitting together on a sofa. He joined them immediately, and, with\n",
      "scarcely an invitation, seated himself between them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Emma, in good spirits too, from the amusement afforded her mind by\n",
      "the expectation of Mr. Frank Churchill, was willing to forget his late\n",
      "improprieties, and be as well satisfied with him as before, and on his\n",
      "making Harriet his very first subject, was ready to listen with most\n",
      "friendly smiles.\n",
      "\n",
      "He professed himself extremely anxious about her fair friend--her fair,\n",
      "lovely, amiable friend. “Did she know?--had she heard any thing about\n",
      "her, since their being at Randalls?--he felt much anxiety--he must\n",
      "confess that the nature of her complaint alarmed him considerably.”\n",
      " And in this style he talked on for some time very properly, not much\n",
      "attending to any answer, but altogether sufficiently awake to the terror\n",
      "of a bad sore throat; and Emma was quite in charity with him.\n",
      "\n",
      "But at last there seemed a perverse turn; it seemed all at once as if he\n",
      "were more afraid of its being a bad sore throat on her account, than on\n",
      "Harriet's--more anxious that she should escape the infection, than\n",
      "that there should be no infection in the complaint. He began with great\n",
      "earnestness to entreat her to refrain from visiting the sick-chamber\n",
      "again, for the present--to entreat her to _promise_ _him_ not to venture\n",
      "into such hazard till he had seen Mr. Perry and learnt his opinion; and\n",
      "though she tried to laugh it off and bring the subject back into its\n",
      "proper course, there was no putting an end to his extreme solicitude\n",
      "about her. She was vexed. It did appear--there was no concealing\n",
      "it--exactly like the pretence of being in love with her, instead of\n",
      "Harriet; an inconstancy, if real, the most contemptible and abominable!\n",
      "and she had difficulty in behaving with temper. He turned to Mrs. Weston\n",
      "to implore her assistance, “Would not she give him her support?--would\n",
      "not she add her persuasions to his, to induce Miss Woodhouse not to go\n",
      "to Mrs. Goddard's till it were certain that Miss Smith's disorder had\n",
      "no infection? He could not be satisfied without a promise--would not she\n",
      "give him her influence in procuring it?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“So scrupulous for others,” he continued, “and yet so careless for\n",
      "herself! She wanted me to nurse my cold by staying at home to-day, and\n",
      "yet will not promise to avoid the danger of catching an ulcerated sore\n",
      "throat herself. Is this fair, Mrs. Weston?--Judge between us. Have not I\n",
      "some right to complain? I am sure of your kind support and aid.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Emma saw Mrs. Weston's surprize, and felt that it must be great, at an\n",
      "address which, in words and manner, was assuming to himself the right of\n",
      "first interest in her; and as for herself, she was too much provoked and\n",
      "offended to have the power of directly saying any thing to the purpose.\n",
      "She could only give him a look; but it was such a look as she thought\n",
      "must restore him to his senses, and then left the sofa, removing to a\n",
      "seat by her sister, and giving her all her attention.\n",
      "\n",
      "She had not time to know how Mr. Elton took the reproof, so rapidly did\n",

      "from examining the weather, and opened on them all with the information\n",

      "fast, with a strong drifting wind; concluding with these words to Mr.\n",
      "Woodhouse:\n",

      "Poor Mr. Woodhouse was silent from consternation; but every body else\n",
      "had something to say; every body was either surprized or not surprized,\n",
      "and had some question to ask, or some comfort to offer. Mrs. Weston\n",
      "and Emma tried earnestly to cheer him and turn his attention from his\n",

      "\n",
      "“I admired your resolution very much, sir,” said he, “in venturing out\n",
      "in such weather, for of course you saw there would be snow very soon.\n",
      "Every body must have seen the snow coming on. I admired your spirit; and\n",
      "I dare say we shall get home very well. Another hour or two's snow can\n",
      "hardly make the road impassable; and we are two carriages; if one is\n",
      "blown over in the bleak part of the common field there will be the other\n",
      "at hand. I dare say we shall be all safe at Hartfield before midnight.”\n",

      "Mr. Weston, with triumph of a different sort, was confessing that he\n",
      "had known it to be snowing some time, but had not said a word, lest\n",
      "it should make Mr. Woodhouse uncomfortable, and be an excuse for his\n",
      "hurrying away. As to there being any quantity of snow fallen or likely\n",
      "to fall to impede their return, that was a mere joke; he was afraid they\n",
      "would find no difficulty. He wished the road might be impassable, that\n",
      "he might be able to keep them all at Randalls; and with the utmost\n",
      "good-will was sure that accommodation might be found for every body,\n",
      "calling on his wife to agree with him, that with a little contrivance,\n",
      "every body might be lodged, which she hardly knew how to do, from the\n",

      "their having so many friends about them, revived him a little.\n",

      "His eldest daughter's alarm was equal to his own. The horror of being\n",

      "in her imagination; and fancying the road to be now just passable for\n",
      "adventurous people, but in a state that admitted no delay, she was eager\n",
      "to have it settled, that her father and Emma should remain at Randalls,\n",

      "“Indeed!” replied he. “Then, my dear Isabella, it is the most\n",
      "extraordinary sort of thing in the world, for in general every thing\n",
      "does give you cold. Walk home!--you are prettily shod for walking home,\n",

      "whiten the ground; a very few flakes were falling at present, but the\n",
      "clouds were parting, and there was every appearance of its being soon\n",

      "of every thing she had been wishing for!--Such a development of every\n",
      "thing most unwelcome!--Such a blow for Harriet!--that was the worst\n",
      "of all. Every part of it brought pain and humiliation, of some sort or\n",

      "she would gladly have submitted to feel yet more mistaken--more in\n",

      "How she could have been so deceived!--He protested that he had never\n",

      "she could; but it was all confusion. She had taken up the idea, she\n",
      "supposed, and made every thing bend to it. His manners, however, must\n",
      "have been unmarked, wavering, dubious, or she could not have been so\n",
      "misled.\n",

      "The picture!--How eager he had been about the picture!--and the\n",
      "charade!--and an hundred other circumstances;--how clearly they had\n",

      "that he had not always lived in the best society, that with all the\n",
      "gentleness of his address, true elegance was sometimes wanting; but,\n",
      "till this very day, she had never, for an instant, suspected it to mean\n",
      "any thing but grateful respect to her as Harriet's friend.\n",
      "\n",
      "To Mr. John Knightley was she indebted for her first idea on the\n",
      "subject, for the first start of its possibility. There was no denying\n",
      "that those brothers had penetration. She remembered what Mr. Knightley\n",
      "had once said to her about Mr. Elton, the caution he had given,\n",

      "respects, the very reverse of what she had meant and believed him;\n",
      "proud, assuming, conceited; very full of his own claims, and little\n",

      "\n",
      "Contrary to the usual course of things, Mr. Elton's wanting to pay his\n",
      "addresses to her had sunk him in her opinion. His professions and his\n",
      "proposals did him no service. She thought nothing of his attachment,\n",
      "and was insulted by his hopes. He wanted to marry well, and having the\n",
      "arrogance to raise his eyes to her, pretended to be in love; but she was\n",
      "perfectly easy as to his not suffering any disappointment that need be\n",
      "cared for. There had been no real affection either in his language or\n",
      "manners. Sighs and fine words had been given in abundance; but she could\n",
      "hardly devise any set of expressions, or fancy any tone of voice, less\n",
      "allied with real love. She need not trouble herself to pity him. He\n",

      "such equality might prevent his perception of it; but he must know that\n",
      "in fortune and consequence she was greatly his superior. He must\n",
      "know that the Woodhouses had been settled for several generations at\n",
      "Hartfield, the younger branch of a very ancient family--and that the\n",

      "inconsiderable, being but a sort of notch in the Donwell Abbey estate,\n",
      "to which all the rest of Highbury belonged; but their fortune, from\n",

      "Mr. Elton had first entered not two years ago, to make his way as he\n",
      "could, without any alliances but in trade, or any thing to recommend him\n",

      "The first error and the worst lay at her door. It was foolish, it was\n",
      "wrong, to take so active a part in bringing any two people together. It\n",
      "was adventuring too far, assuming too much, making light of what\n",

      "\n",
      "“Here have I,” said she, “actually talked poor Harriet into being very\n",

      "Jane, apologise for her writing so short a letter--only two pages you\n",
      "see--hardly two--and in general she fills the whole paper and crosses\n",
      "half. My mother often wonders that I can make it out so well. She often\n",
      "says, when the letter is first opened, 'Well, Hetty, now I think\n",
      "you will be put to it to make out all that checker-work'--don't you,\n",

      "amazingly well still, thank God! with the help of spectacles. It is such\n",
      "a blessing! My mother's are really very good indeed. Jane often says,\n",

      "rude, of making her escape from Jane Fairfax's letter, and had almost\n",

      "fond of Jane that I dare say he would not mean to charge any thing for\n",
      "attendance, we could not suffer it to be so, you know. He has a wife and\n",

      "fully competent to the office of instruction herself; but she was too\n",

      "by the young woman, nor could her higher powers of mind be unfelt by the\n",
      "parents. They continued together with unabated regard however, till the\n",
      "marriage of Miss Campbell, who by that chance, that luck which so often\n",

      "of ease and leisure as must now be relinquished. Still, however,\n",
      "affection was glad to catch at any reasonable excuse for not hurrying\n",
      "on the wretched moment. She had never been quite well since the time of\n",
      "their daughter's marriage; and till she should have completely recovered\n",
      "her usual strength, they must forbid her engaging in duties, which, so\n",
      "far from being compatible with a weakened frame and varying spirits,\n",

      "had been so long promised it--Mr. Frank Churchill--must put up for the\n",

      "years' absence.\n",
      "\n",
      "Emma was sorry;--to have to pay civilities to a person she did not like\n",
      "through three long months!--to be always doing more than she wished,\n",
      "and less than she ought! Why she did not like Jane Fairfax might be a\n",
      "difficult question to answer; Mr. Knightley had once told her it was\n",
      "because she saw in her the really accomplished young woman, which she\n",
      "wanted to be thought herself; and though the accusation had been eagerly\n",
      "refuted at the time, there were moments of self-examination in which\n",
      "her conscience could not quite acquit her. But “she could never get\n",
      "acquainted with her: she did not know how it was, but there was such\n",
      "coldness and reserve--such apparent indifference whether she pleased or\n",
      "not--and then, her aunt was such an eternal talker!--and she was made\n",
      "such a fuss with by every body!--and it had been always imagined that\n",
      "they were to be so intimate--because their ages were the same, every\n",
      "body had supposed they must be so fond of each other.” These were her\n",
      "reasons--she had no better.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was a dislike so little just--every imputed fault was so magnified\n",
      "by fancy, that she never saw Jane Fairfax the first time after any\n",
      "considerable absence, without feeling that she had injured her; and\n",
      "now, when the due visit was paid, on her arrival, after a two years'\n",
      "interval, she was particularly struck with the very appearance and\n",
      "manners, which for those two whole years she had been depreciating. Jane\n",
      "Fairfax was very elegant, remarkably elegant; and she had herself the\n",
      "highest value for elegance. Her height was pretty, just such as almost\n",
      "every body would think tall, and nobody could think very tall; her\n",
      "figure particularly graceful; her size a most becoming medium, between\n",
      "fat and thin, though a slight appearance of ill-health seemed to point\n",
      "out the likeliest evil of the two. Emma could not but feel all this; and\n",
      "then, her face--her features--there was more beauty in them altogether\n",
      "than she had remembered; it was not regular, but it was very pleasing\n",
      "beauty. Her eyes, a deep grey, with dark eye-lashes and eyebrows, had\n",
      "never been denied their praise; but the skin, which she had been used to\n",
      "cavil at, as wanting colour, had a clearness and delicacy which really\n",
      "needed no fuller bloom. It was a style of beauty, of which elegance was\n",
      "the reigning character, and as such, she must, in honour, by all her\n",
      "principles, admire it:--elegance, which, whether of person or of mind,\n",
      "she saw so little in Highbury. There, not to be vulgar, was distinction,\n",
      "and merit.\n",
      "\n",
      "In short, she sat, during the first visit, looking at Jane Fairfax with\n",
      "twofold complacency; the sense of pleasure and the sense of rendering\n",
      "justice, and was determining that she would dislike her no longer. When\n",
      "she took in her history, indeed, her situation, as well as her beauty;\n",
      "when she considered what all this elegance was destined to, what she was\n",
      "going to sink from, how she was going to live, it seemed impossible\n",
      "to feel any thing but compassion and respect; especially, if to every\n",
      "well-known particular entitling her to interest, were added the highly\n",
      "probable circumstance of an attachment to Mr. Dixon, which she had\n",
      "so naturally started to herself. In that case, nothing could be more\n",
      "pitiable or more honourable than the sacrifices she had resolved on.\n",
      "Emma was very willing now to acquit her of having seduced Mr. Dixon's\n",
      "actions from his wife, or of any thing mischievous which her imagination\n",
      "had suggested at first. If it were love, it might be simple, single,\n",
      "successless love on her side alone. She might have been unconsciously\n",
      "sucking in the sad poison, while a sharer of his conversation with her\n",
      "friend; and from the best, the purest of motives, might now be\n",
      "denying herself this visit to Ireland, and resolving to divide herself\n",
      "effectually from him and his connexions by soon beginning her career of\n",
      "laborious duty.\n",
      "\n",
      "Upon the whole, Emma left her with such softened, charitable feelings,\n",
      "as made her look around in walking home, and lament that Highbury\n",
      "afforded no young man worthy of giving her independence; nobody that she\n",
      "could wish to scheme about for her.\n",
      "\n",
      "These were charming feelings--but not lasting. Before she had committed\n",
      "herself by any public profession of eternal friendship for Jane Fairfax,\n",
      "or done more towards a recantation of past prejudices and errors, than\n",
      "saying to Mr. Knightley, “She certainly is handsome; she is better than\n",
      "handsome!” Jane had spent an evening at Hartfield with her grandmother\n",
      "and aunt, and every thing was relapsing much into its usual state.\n",
      "Former provocations reappeared. The aunt was as tiresome as ever; more\n",
      "tiresome, because anxiety for her health was now added to admiration\n",
      "of her powers; and they had to listen to the description of exactly how\n",
      "little bread and butter she ate for breakfast, and how small a slice\n",
      "of mutton for dinner, as well as to see exhibitions of new caps and new\n",
      "workbags for her mother and herself; and Jane's offences rose again.\n",
      "They had music; Emma was obliged to play; and the thanks and praise\n",
      "which necessarily followed appeared to her an affectation of candour, an\n",
      "air of greatness, meaning only to shew off in higher style her own very\n",
      "superior performance. She was, besides, which was the worst of all, so\n",
      "cold, so cautious! There was no getting at her real opinion. Wrapt up in\n",
      "a cloak of politeness, she seemed determined to hazard nothing. She was\n",
      "disgustingly, was suspiciously reserved.\n",
      "\n",
      "If any thing could be more, where all was most, she was more reserved on\n",
      "the subject of Weymouth and the Dixons than any thing. She seemed bent\n",
      "on giving no real insight into Mr. Dixon's character, or her own value\n",
      "for his company, or opinion of the suitableness of the match. It was all\n",
      "general approbation and smoothness; nothing delineated or distinguished.\n",
      "It did her no service however. Her caution was thrown away. Emma saw\n",
      "its artifice, and returned to her first surmises. There probably _was_\n",
      "something more to conceal than her own preference; Mr. Dixon, perhaps,\n",
      "had been very near changing one friend for the other, or been fixed only\n",
      "to Miss Campbell, for the sake of the future twelve thousand pounds.\n",
      "\n",
      "The like reserve prevailed on other topics. She and Mr. Frank Churchill\n",
      "had been at Weymouth at the same time. It was known that they were a\n",
      "little acquainted; but not a syllable of real information could Emma\n",
      "procure as to what he truly was. “Was he handsome?”--“She believed\n",
      "he was reckoned a very fine young man.” “Was he agreeable?”--“He was\n",
      "generally thought so.” “Did he appear a sensible young man; a young\n",
      "man of information?”--“At a watering-place, or in a common London\n",
      "acquaintance, it was difficult to decide on such points. Manners were\n",
      "all that could be safely judged of, under a much longer knowledge than\n",
      "they had yet had of Mr. Churchill. She believed every body found his\n",

      "Emma could not forgive her;--but as neither provocation nor resentment\n",
      "were discerned by Mr. Knightley, who had been of the party, and had\n",
      "seen only proper attention and pleasing behaviour on each side, he was\n",
      "expressing the next morning, being at Hartfield again on business with\n",
      "Mr. Woodhouse, his approbation of the whole; not so openly as he might\n",
      "have done had her father been out of the room, but speaking plain enough\n",
      "to be very intelligible to Emma. He had been used to think her unjust to\n",

      "\n",
      "“A very pleasant evening,” he began, as soon as Mr. Woodhouse had been\n",
      "talked into what was necessary, told that he understood, and the papers\n",
      "swept away;--“particularly pleasant. You and Miss Fairfax gave us some\n",
      "very good music. I do not know a more luxurious state, sir, than sitting\n",
      "at one's ease to be entertained a whole evening by two such young women;\n",
      "sometimes with music and sometimes with conversation. I am sure Miss\n",
      "Fairfax must have found the evening pleasant, Emma. You left nothing\n",
      "undone. I was glad you made her play so much, for having no instrument\n",
      "at her grandmother's, it must have been a real indulgence.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I am happy you approved,” said Emma, smiling; “but I hope I am not\n",
      "often deficient in what is due to guests at Hartfield.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No, my dear,” said her father instantly; “_that_ I am sure you are not.\n",
      "There is nobody half so attentive and civil as you are. If any thing,\n",
      "you are too attentive. The muffin last night--if it had been handed\n",
      "round once, I think it would have been enough.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No,” said Mr. Knightley, nearly at the same time; “you are not often\n",

      "\n",
      "“That's right, my dear, very right. I had not thought of it before, but\n",
      "that is the best way. They must not over-salt the leg; and then, if it\n",
      "is not over-salted, and if it is very thoroughly boiled, just as Serle\n",

      "friend called for her at Mrs. Goddard's, her evil stars had led her\n",
      "to the very spot where, at that moment, a trunk, directed to _The Rev.\n",
      "Philip Elton, White-Hart, Bath_, was to be seen under the operation of\n",
      "being lifted into the butcher's cart, which was to convey it to where\n",

      "and the direction, was consequently a blank.\n",
      "\n",
      "She went, however; and when they reached the farm, and she was to be\n",
      "put down, at the end of the broad, neat gravel walk, which led between\n",
      "espalier apple-trees to the front door, the sight of every thing which\n",
      "had given her so much pleasure the autumn before, was beginning to\n",
      "revive a little local agitation; and when they parted, Emma observed her\n",
      "to be looking around with a sort of fearful curiosity, which determined\n",
      "her not to allow the visit to exceed the proposed quarter of an hour.\n",
      "She went on herself, to give that portion of time to an old servant who\n",
      "was married, and settled in Donwell.\n",
      "\n",
      "The quarter of an hour brought her punctually to the white gate again;\n",
      "and Miss Smith receiving her summons, was with her without delay, and\n",
      "unattended by any alarming young man. She came solitarily down the\n",
      "gravel walk--a Miss Martin just appearing at the door, and parting with\n",
      "her seemingly with ceremonious civility.\n",
      "\n",
      "Harriet could not very soon give an intelligible account. She was\n",
      "feeling too much; but at last Emma collected from her enough to\n",
      "understand the sort of meeting, and the sort of pain it was creating.\n",
      "She had seen only Mrs. Martin and the two girls. They had received her\n",
      "doubtingly, if not coolly; and nothing beyond the merest commonplace had\n",
      "been talked almost all the time--till just at last, when Mrs. Martin's\n",
      "saying, all of a sudden, that she thought Miss Smith was grown, had\n",
      "brought on a more interesting subject, and a warmer manner. In that very\n",
      "room she had been measured last September, with her two friends. There\n",
      "were the pencilled marks and memorandums on the wainscot by the window.\n",
      "_He_ had done it. They all seemed to remember the day, the hour,\n",
      "the party, the occasion--to feel the same consciousness, the same\n",
      "regrets--to be ready to return to the same good understanding; and they\n",
      "were just growing again like themselves, (Harriet, as Emma must suspect,\n",
      "as ready as the best of them to be cordial and happy,) when the carriage\n",
      "reappeared, and all was over. The style of the visit, and the shortness\n",
      "of it, were then felt to be decisive. Fourteen minutes to be given\n",
      "to those with whom she had thankfully passed six weeks not six months\n",
      "ago!--Emma could not but picture it all, and feel how justly they might\n",
      "resent, how naturally Harriet must suffer. It was a bad business. She\n",
      "would have given a great deal, or endured a great deal, to have had\n",
      "the Martins in a higher rank of life. They were so deserving, that a\n",
      "_little_ higher should have been enough: but as it was, how could she\n",
      "have done otherwise?--Impossible!--She could not repent. They must be\n",
      "separated; but there was a great deal of pain in the process--so much\n",
      "to herself at this time, that she soon felt the necessity of a little\n",
      "consolation, and resolved on going home by way of Randalls to\n",
      "procure it. Her mind was quite sick of Mr. Elton and the Martins. The\n",
      "refreshment of Randalls was absolutely necessary.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was a good scheme; but on driving to the door they heard that neither\n",
      "“master nor mistress was at home;” they had both been out some time; the\n",
      "man believed they were gone to Hartfield.\n",
      "\n",
      "“This is too bad,” cried Emma, as they turned away. “And now we shall\n",
      "just miss them; too provoking!--I do not know when I have been so\n",
      "disappointed.” And she leaned back in the corner, to indulge her\n",
      "murmurs, or to reason them away; probably a little of both--such being\n",
      "the commonest process of a not ill-disposed mind. Presently the carriage\n",
      "stopt; she looked up; it was stopt by Mr. and Mrs. Weston, who were\n",
      "standing to speak to her. There was instant pleasure in the sight of\n",
      "them, and still greater pleasure was conveyed in sound--for Mr. Weston\n",

      "morning--we see him to-morrow by dinner-time to a certainty--he is at\n",
      "Oxford to-day, and he comes for a whole fortnight; I knew it would be\n",
      "so. If he had come at Christmas he could not have staid three days; I\n",
      "was always glad he did not come at Christmas; now we are going to have\n",

      "by the words and the countenance of his wife, fewer and quieter, but not\n",
      "less to the purpose. To know that _she_ thought his coming certain was\n",
      "enough to make Emma consider it so, and sincerely did she rejoice in\n",
      "their joy. It was a most delightful reanimation of exhausted spirits.\n",
      "The worn-out past was sunk in the freshness of what was coming; and in\n",

      "been said in his praise; he was a _very_ good looking young man; height,\n",
      "air, address, all were unexceptionable, and his countenance had a great\n",
      "deal of the spirit and liveliness of his father's; he looked quick and\n",
      "sensible. She felt immediately that she should like him; and there was\n",
      "a well-bred ease of manner, and a readiness to talk, which convinced her\n",
      "that he came intending to be acquainted with her, and that acquainted\n",
      "they soon must be.\n",

      "He had reached Randalls the evening before. She was pleased with the\n",

      "allow it even to be very small, admired the situation, the walk to\n",
      "Highbury, Highbury itself, Hartfield still more, and professed himself\n",
      "to have always felt the sort of interest in the country which none but\n",
      "one's _own_ country gives, and the greatest curiosity to visit it. That\n",
      "he should never have been able to indulge so amiable a feeling before,\n",
      "passed suspiciously through Emma's brain; but still, if it were a\n",
      "falsehood, it was a pleasant one, and pleasantly handled. His manner had\n",

      "undoubtedly he could know very little of the matter. He understood\n",
      "what would be welcome; he could be sure of little else. “His father's\n",

      "character, than Miss Woodhouse Miss Taylor's. And at last, as if\n",
      "resolved to qualify his opinion completely for travelling round to its\n",

      "“Elegant, agreeable manners, I was prepared for,” said he; “but I\n",

      "I was to find a pretty young woman in Mrs. Weston.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You cannot see too much perfection in Mrs. Weston for my feelings,”\n",

      "\n",
      "“I hope I should know better,” he replied; “no, depend upon it, (with a\n",

      "terms.”\n",

      "had ever crossed his; and whether his compliments were to be considered\n",
      "as marks of acquiescence, or proofs of defiance. She must see more\n",
      "of him to understand his ways; at present she only felt they were\n",
      "agreeable.\n",
      "\n",
      "She had no doubt of what Mr. Weston was often thinking about. His quick\n",
      "eye she detected again and again glancing towards them with a happy\n",

      "confident that he was often listening.\n",

      "Her own father's perfect exemption from any thought of the kind, the\n",
      "entire deficiency in him of all such sort of penetration or suspicion,\n",
      "was a most comfortable circumstance. Happily he was not farther from\n",
      "approving matrimony than from foreseeing it.--Though always objecting\n",
      "to every marriage that was arranged, he never suffered beforehand from\n",
      "the apprehension of any; it seemed as if he could not think so ill of\n",
      "any two persons' understanding as to suppose they meant to marry till it\n",
      "were proved against them. She blessed the favouring blindness. He could\n",

      "Weston, to whom and to Highbury he seemed to take very cordially. He had\n",
      "been sitting with her, it appeared, most companionably at home, till\n",
      "her usual hour of exercise; and on being desired to chuse their walk,\n",
      "immediately fixed on Highbury.--“He did not doubt there being very\n",
      "pleasant walks in every direction, but if left to him, he should always\n",
      "chuse the same. Highbury, that airy, cheerful, happy-looking Highbury,\n",
      "would be his constant attraction.”--Highbury, with Mrs. Weston, stood\n",
      "for Hartfield; and she trusted to its bearing the same construction with\n",
      "him. They walked thither directly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Emma had hardly expected them: for Mr. Weston, who had called in for\n",
      "half a minute, in order to hear that his son was very handsome, knew\n",
      "nothing of their plans; and it was an agreeable surprize to her,\n",
      "therefore, to perceive them walking up to the house together, arm in\n",
      "arm. She was wanting to see him again, and especially to see him in\n",
      "company with Mrs. Weston, upon his behaviour to whom her opinion of him\n",
      "was to depend. If he were deficient there, nothing should make amends\n",
      "for it. But on seeing them together, she became perfectly satisfied. It\n",
      "was not merely in fine words or hyperbolical compliment that he paid his\n",
      "duty; nothing could be more proper or pleasing than his whole manner to\n",
      "her--nothing could more agreeably denote his wish of considering her as\n",
      "a friend and securing her affection. And there was time enough for Emma\n",
      "to form a reasonable judgment, as their visit included all the rest of\n",
      "the morning. They were all three walking about together for an hour\n",
      "or two--first round the shrubberies of Hartfield, and afterwards\n",
      "in Highbury. He was delighted with every thing; admired Hartfield\n",
      "sufficiently for Mr. Woodhouse's ear; and when their going farther was\n",
      "resolved on, confessed his wish to be made acquainted with the whole\n",
      "village, and found matter of commendation and interest much oftener than\n",
      "Emma could have supposed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some of the objects of his curiosity spoke very amiable feelings. He\n",
      "begged to be shewn the house which his father had lived in so long, and\n",
      "which had been the home of his father's father; and on recollecting that\n",
      "an old woman who had nursed him was still living, walked in quest of\n",
      "her cottage from one end of the street to the other; and though in\n",
      "some points of pursuit or observation there was no positive merit, they\n",
      "shewed, altogether, a good-will towards Highbury in general, which must\n",
      "be very like a merit to those he was with.\n",
      "\n",
      "Emma watched and decided, that with such feelings as were now shewn, it\n",
      "could not be fairly supposed that he had been ever voluntarily absenting\n",
      "himself; that he had not been acting a part, or making a parade of\n",
      "insincere professions; and that Mr. Knightley certainly had not done him\n",
      "justice.\n",
      "\n",
      "Their first pause was at the Crown Inn, an inconsiderable house, though\n",
      "the principal one of the sort, where a couple of pair of post-horses\n",
      "were kept, more for the convenience of the neighbourhood than from any\n",
      "run on the road; and his companions had not expected to be detained by\n",
      "any interest excited there; but in passing it they gave the history of\n",
      "the large room visibly added; it had been built many years ago for\n",
      "a ball-room, and while the neighbourhood had been in a particularly\n",
      "populous, dancing state, had been occasionally used as such;--but such\n",
      "brilliant days had long passed away, and now the highest purpose for\n",
      "which it was ever wanted was to accommodate a whist club established\n",
      "among the gentlemen and half-gentlemen of the place. He was immediately\n",
      "interested. Its character as a ball-room caught him; and instead of\n",
      "passing on, he stopt for several minutes at the two superior sashed\n",
      "windows which were open, to look in and contemplate its capabilities,\n",
      "and lament that its original purpose should have ceased. He saw no fault\n",
      "in the room, he would acknowledge none which they suggested. No, it\n",
      "was long enough, broad enough, handsome enough. It would hold the\n",
      "very number for comfort. They ought to have balls there at least every\n",
      "fortnight through the winter. Why had not Miss Woodhouse revived\n",
      "the former good old days of the room?--She who could do any thing in\n",
      "Highbury! The want of proper families in the place, and the conviction\n",
      "that none beyond the place and its immediate environs could be tempted\n",
      "to attend, were mentioned; but he was not satisfied. He could not be\n",
      "persuaded that so many good-looking houses as he saw around him, could\n",
      "not furnish numbers enough for such a meeting; and even when particulars\n",
      "were given and families described, he was still unwilling to admit that\n",
      "the inconvenience of such a mixture would be any thing, or that there\n",
      "would be the smallest difficulty in every body's returning into their\n",
      "proper place the next morning. He argued like a young man very much bent\n",
      "on dancing; and Emma was rather surprized to see the constitution of\n",
      "the Weston prevail so decidedly against the habits of the Churchills.\n",
      "He seemed to have all the life and spirit, cheerful feelings, and social\n",
      "inclinations of his father, and nothing of the pride or reserve of\n",
      "Enscombe. Of pride, indeed, there was, perhaps, scarcely enough; his\n",
      "indifference to a confusion of rank, bordered too much on inelegance of\n",
      "mind. He could be no judge, however, of the evil he was holding cheap.\n",
      "It was but an effusion of lively spirits.\n",
      "\n",
      "At last he was persuaded to move on from the front of the Crown;\n",
      "and being now almost facing the house where the Bateses lodged, Emma\n",
      "recollected his intended visit the day before, and asked him if he had\n",
      "paid it.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, oh! yes”--he replied; “I was just going to mention it. A very\n",
      "successful visit:--I saw all the three ladies; and felt very much\n",
      "obliged to you for your preparatory hint. If the talking aunt had taken\n",
      "me quite by surprize, it must have been the death of me. As it was, I\n",
      "was only betrayed into paying a most unreasonable visit. Ten minutes\n",
      "would have been all that was necessary, perhaps all that was proper; and\n",
      "I had told my father I should certainly be at home before him--but there\n",
      "was no getting away, no pause; and, to my utter astonishment, I found,\n",
      "when he (finding me nowhere else) joined me there at last, that I had\n",
      "been actually sitting with them very nearly three-quarters of an hour.\n",
      "The good lady had not given me the possibility of escape before.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“And how did you think Miss Fairfax looking?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ill, very ill--that is, if a young lady can ever be allowed to look\n",
      "ill. But the expression is hardly admissible, Mrs. Weston, is it? Ladies\n",
      "can never look ill. And, seriously, Miss Fairfax is naturally so\n",
      "pale, as almost always to give the appearance of ill health.--A most\n",
      "deplorable want of complexion.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Emma would not agree to this, and began a warm defence of Miss Fairfax's\n",
      "complexion. “It was certainly never brilliant, but she would not\n",
      "allow it to have a sickly hue in general; and there was a softness and\n",
      "delicacy in her skin which gave peculiar elegance to the character of\n",
      "her face.” He listened with all due deference; acknowledged that he had\n",
      "heard many people say the same--but yet he must confess, that to him\n",
      "nothing could make amends for the want of the fine glow of health. Where\n",
      "features were indifferent, a fine complexion gave beauty to them all;\n",
      "and where they were good, the effect was--fortunately he need not\n",
      "attempt to describe what the effect was.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well,” said Emma, “there is no disputing about taste.--At least you\n",
      "admire her except her complexion.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He shook his head and laughed.--“I cannot separate Miss Fairfax and her\n",
      "complexion.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Did you see her often at Weymouth? Were you often in the same society?”\n",
      "\n",
      "At this moment they were approaching Ford's, and he hastily exclaimed,\n",
      "“Ha! this must be the very shop that every body attends every day of\n",
      "their lives, as my father informs me. He comes to Highbury himself, he\n",
      "says, six days out of the seven, and has always business at Ford's.\n",
      "If it be not inconvenient to you, pray let us go in, that I may prove\n",
      "myself to belong to the place, to be a true citizen of Highbury. I must\n",
      "buy something at Ford's. It will be taking out my freedom.--I dare say\n",
      "they sell gloves.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh! yes, gloves and every thing. I do admire your patriotism. You will\n",
      "be adored in Highbury. You were very popular before you came, because\n",
      "you were Mr. Weston's son--but lay out half a guinea at Ford's, and your\n",
      "popularity will stand upon your own virtues.”\n",
      "\n",

      " and “York Tan” were bringing down and displaying on the counter, he\n",
      "said--“But I beg your pardon, Miss Woodhouse, you were speaking to me,\n",
      "you were saying something at the very moment of this burst of my _amor_\n",
      "_patriae_. Do not let me lose it. I assure you the utmost stretch of\n",

      "very unfair one. It is always the lady's right to decide on the degree\n",
      "of acquaintance. Miss Fairfax must already have given her account.--I\n",
      "shall not commit myself by claiming more than she may chuse to allow.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Upon my word! you answer as discreetly as she could do herself. But\n",

      "with her.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“May I, indeed?--Then I will speak the truth, and nothing suits me so\n",
      "well. I met her frequently at Weymouth. I had known the Campbells a\n",
      "little in town; and at Weymouth we were very much in the same set.\n",

      "excessively fond of music, but without the smallest skill or right\n",

      "to sit down to the instrument, if the lady in question could sit down\n",

      "\n",

      "dulness of feeling--there was one person, I think, who must have felt\n",

      "disgust towards a girl so idolized and so cried up as she always was,\n",
      "by her aunt and grandmother, and all their set. And then, her reserve--I\n",

      "conquering any body's reserve to procure one. Intimacy between Miss\n",

      "not exactly what she had expected; less of the man of the world in some\n",
      "of his notions, less of the spoiled child of fortune, therefore better\n",

      "his hair cut. A sudden freak seemed to have seized him at breakfast, and\n",
      "he had sent for a chaise and set off, intending to return to dinner,\n",
      "but with no more important view that appeared than having his hair cut.\n",
      "There was certainly no harm in his travelling sixteen miles twice over\n",
      "on such an errand; but there was an air of foppery and nonsense in it\n",
      "which she could not approve. It did not accord with the rationality of\n",
      "plan, the moderation in expense, or even the unselfish warmth of heart,\n",
      "which she had believed herself to discern in him yesterday. Vanity,\n",
      "extravagance, love of change, restlessness of temper, which must be\n",
      "doing something, good or bad; heedlessness as to the pleasure of his\n",
      "father and Mrs. Weston, indifferent as to how his conduct might appear\n",
      "in general; he became liable to all these charges. His father only\n",
      "called him a coxcomb, and thought it a very good story; but that Mrs.\n",
      "Weston did not like it, was clear enough, by her passing it over as\n",

      "With the exception of this little blot, Emma found that his visit\n",
      "hitherto had given her friend only good ideas of him. Mrs. Weston\n",
      "was very ready to say how attentive and pleasant a companion he made\n",
      "himself--how much she saw to like in his disposition altogether. He\n",
      "appeared to have a very open temper--certainly a very cheerful and\n",
      "lively one; she could observe nothing wrong in his notions, a great deal\n",
      "decidedly right; he spoke of his uncle with warm regard, was fond of\n",
      "talking of him--said he would be the best man in the world if he were\n",
      "left to himself; and though there was no being attached to the aunt, he\n",
      "acknowledged her kindness with gratitude, and seemed to mean always to\n",
      "speak of her with respect. This was all very promising; and, but for\n",
      "such an unfortunate fancy for having his hair cut, there was nothing to\n",
      "denote him unworthy of the distinguished honour which her imagination\n",
      "had given him; the honour, if not of being really in love with her,\n",
      "of being at least very near it, and saved only by her own\n",
      "indifference--(for still her resolution held of never marrying)--the\n",
      "honour, in short, of being marked out for her by all their joint\n",
      "acquaintance.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Weston, on his side, added a virtue to the account which must\n",

      "extremely--thought her very beautiful and very charming; and with so\n",
      "much to be said for him altogether, she found she must not judge him\n",
      "harshly. As Mrs. Weston observed, “all young people would have their\n",
      "little whims.”\n",
      "\n",
      "There was one person among his new acquaintance in Surry, not so\n",
      "leniently disposed. In general he was judged, throughout the parishes of\n",
      "Donwell and Highbury, with great candour; liberal allowances were made\n",
      "for the little excesses of such a handsome young man--one who smiled so\n",
      "often and bowed so well; but there was one spirit among them not to be\n",
      "softened, from its power of censure, by bows or smiles--Mr. Knightley.\n",
      "The circumstance was told him at Hartfield; for the moment, he was\n",
      "silent; but Emma heard him almost immediately afterwards say to himself,\n",
      "over a newspaper he held in his hand, “Hum! just the trifling, silly\n",
      "fellow I took him for.” She had half a mind to resent; but an instant's\n",
      "observation convinced her that it was really said only to relieve his\n",
      "own feelings, and not meant to provoke; and therefore she let it pass.\n",
      "\n",
      "Although in one instance the bearers of not good tidings, Mr. and\n",
      "Mrs. Weston's visit this morning was in another respect particularly\n",
      "opportune. Something occurred while they were at Hartfield, to make Emma\n",
      "want their advice; and, which was still more lucky, she wanted exactly\n",
      "the advice they gave.\n",
      "\n",
      "This was the occurrence:--The Coles had been settled some years in\n",
      "Highbury, and were very good sort of people--friendly, liberal, and\n",
      "unpretending; but, on the other hand, they were of low origin, in trade,\n",
      "and only moderately genteel. On their first coming into the country,\n",
      "they had lived in proportion to their income, quietly, keeping little\n",
      "company, and that little unexpensively; but the last year or two had\n",
      "brought them a considerable increase of means--the house in town had\n",
      "yielded greater profits, and fortune in general had smiled on them. With\n",
      "their wealth, their views increased; their want of a larger house, their\n",
      "inclination for more company. They added to their house, to their number\n",
      "of servants, to their expenses of every sort; and by this time were,\n",
      "in fortune and style of living, second only to the family at Hartfield.\n",
      "Their love of society, and their new dining-room, prepared every body\n",
      "for their keeping dinner-company; and a few parties, chiefly among the\n",
      "single men, had already taken place. The regular and best families Emma\n",
      "could hardly suppose they would presume to invite--neither Donwell, nor\n",
      "Hartfield, nor Randalls. Nothing should tempt _her_ to go, if they did;\n",
      "and she regretted that her father's known habits would be giving\n",
      "her refusal less meaning than she could wish. The Coles were very\n",
      "respectable in their way, but they ought to be taught that it was not\n",
      "for them to arrange the terms on which the superior families would visit\n",
      "them. This lesson, she very much feared, they would receive only from\n",
      "herself; she had little hope of Mr. Knightley, none of Mr. Weston.\n",
      "\n",
      "But she had made up her mind how to meet this presumption so many weeks\n",
      "before it appeared, that when the insult came at last, it found her\n",
      "very differently affected. Donwell and Randalls had received their\n",
      "invitation, and none had come for her father and herself; and Mrs.\n",
      "Weston's accounting for it with “I suppose they will not take the\n",
      "liberty with you; they know you do not dine out,” was not quite\n",
      "sufficient. She felt that she should like to have had the power of\n",
      "refusal; and afterwards, as the idea of the party to be assembled there,\n",
      "consisting precisely of those whose society was dearest to her, occurred\n",
      "again and again, she did not know that she might not have been tempted\n",
      "to accept. Harriet was to be there in the evening, and the Bateses. They\n",
      "had been speaking of it as they walked about Highbury the day before,\n",
      "and Frank Churchill had most earnestly lamented her absence. Might\n",
      "not the evening end in a dance? had been a question of his. The bare\n",
      "possibility of it acted as a farther irritation on her spirits; and\n",
      "her being left in solitary grandeur, even supposing the omission to be\n",
      "intended as a compliment, was but poor comfort.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was the arrival of this very invitation while the Westons were at\n",
      "Hartfield, which made their presence so acceptable; for though her first\n",
      "remark, on reading it, was that “of course it must be declined,” she so\n",
      "very soon proceeded to ask them what they advised her to do, that their\n",
      "advice for her going was most prompt and successful.\n",
      "\n",
      "She owned that, considering every thing, she was not absolutely\n",
      "without inclination for the party. The Coles expressed themselves so\n",
      "properly--there was so much real attention in the manner of it--so much\n",
      "consideration for her father. “They would have solicited the honour\n",
      "earlier, but had been waiting the arrival of a folding-screen from\n",
      "London, which they hoped might keep Mr. Woodhouse from any draught of\n",
      "air, and therefore induce him the more readily to give them the honour\n",
      "of his company.” Upon the whole, she was very persuadable; and it being\n",
      "briefly settled among themselves how it might be done without neglecting\n",
      "his comfort--how certainly Mrs. Goddard, if not Mrs. Bates, might be\n",
      "depended on for bearing him company--Mr. Woodhouse was to be talked\n",
      "into an acquiescence of his daughter's going out to dinner on a day now\n",
      "near at hand, and spending the whole evening away from him. As for _his_\n",
      "going, Emma did not wish him to think it possible, the hours would be\n",
      "too late, and the party too numerous. He was soon pretty well resigned.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I am not fond of dinner-visiting,” said he--“I never was. No more is\n",
      "Emma. Late hours do not agree with us. I am sorry Mr. and Mrs. Cole\n",
      "should have done it. I think it would be much better if they would come\n",
      "in one afternoon next summer, and take their tea with us--take us\n",
      "in their afternoon walk; which they might do, as our hours are so\n",
      "reasonable, and yet get home without being out in the damp of the\n",
      "evening. The dews of a summer evening are what I would not expose any\n",
      "body to. However, as they are so very desirous to have dear Emma dine\n",
      "with them, and as you will both be there, and Mr. Knightley too, to take\n",
      "care of her, I cannot wish to prevent it, provided the weather be what\n",
      "it ought, neither damp, nor cold, nor windy.” Then turning to Mrs.\n",
      "Weston, with a look of gentle reproach--“Ah! Miss Taylor, if you had not\n",
      "married, you would have staid at home with me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, sir,” cried Mr. Weston, “as I took Miss Taylor away, it is\n",
      "incumbent on me to supply her place, if I can; and I will step to Mrs.\n",
      "Goddard in a moment, if you wish it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "But the idea of any thing to be done in a _moment_, was increasing,\n",
      "not lessening, Mr. Woodhouse's agitation. The ladies knew better how\n",
      "to allay it. Mr. Weston must be quiet, and every thing deliberately\n",
      "arranged.\n",
      "\n",
      "With this treatment, Mr. Woodhouse was soon composed enough for talking\n",
      "as usual. “He should be happy to see Mrs. Goddard. He had a great regard\n",
      "for Mrs. Goddard; and Emma should write a line, and invite her. James\n",

      "their obliging invitation; beginning with my _compliments_, of course.\n",
      "But you will do every thing right. I need not tell you what is to be\n",
      "done. We must remember to let James know that the carriage will be\n",
      "wanted on Tuesday. I shall have no fears for you with him. We have never\n",

      "no doubt that James will take you very safely. And when you get there,\n",
      "you must tell him at what time you would have him come for you again;\n",

      "\n",
      "“No, upon no account in the world, Mr. Weston; I am much obliged to\n",

      "pain. I know what worthy people they are. Perry tells me that Mr. Cole\n",
      "never touches malt liquor. You would not think it to look at him, but\n",
      "he is bilious--Mr. Cole is very bilious. No, I would not be the means\n",

      "scruples of staying as late as Mrs. Weston, but on your account. I am\n",
      "only afraid of your sitting up for me. I am not afraid of your not being\n",

      "know; but when she is gone home, I am afraid you will be sitting up by\n",
      "yourself, instead of going to bed at your usual time--and the idea of\n",

      "drawing-room, while I do not know one note from another, and our little\n",
      "girls, who are but just beginning, perhaps may never make any thing of\n",
      "it; and there is poor Jane Fairfax, who is mistress of music, has not\n",
      "any thing of the nature of an instrument, not even the pitifullest old\n",

      "Mr. Cole but yesterday, and he quite agreed with me; only he is so\n",
      "particularly fond of music that he could not help indulging himself\n",
      "in the purchase, hoping that some of our good neighbours might be so\n",
      "obliging occasionally to put it to a better use than we can; and that\n",
      "really is the reason why the instrument was bought--or else I am sure\n",

      "acuteness than I deserve. I smile because you smile, and shall probably\n",
      "suspect whatever I find you suspect; but at present I do not see what\n",

      "\n",
      "“What do you say to Mrs. Dixon?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Mrs. Dixon! very true indeed. I had not thought of Mrs. Dixon. She must\n",
      "know as well as her father, how acceptable an instrument would be; and\n",
      "perhaps the mode of it, the mystery, the surprize, is more like a young\n",
      "woman's scheme than an elderly man's. It is Mrs. Dixon, I dare say. I\n",

      "know, of his being so warm an admirer of her performance.”\n",
      "\n",

      "that, after making his proposals to her friend, he had the misfortune\n",
      "to fall in love with _her_, or that he became conscious of a little\n",

      "to Ireland. Here, she must be leading a life of privation and penance;\n",
      "there it would have been all enjoyment. As to the pretence of trying her\n",
      "native air, I look upon that as a mere excuse.--In the summer it might\n",
      "have passed; but what can any body's native air do for them in the\n",
      "months of January, February, and March? Good fires and carriages would\n",
      "be much more to the purpose in most cases of delicate health, and I dare\n",
      "say in her's. I do not require you to adopt all my suspicions, though\n",
      "you make so noble a profession of doing it, but I honestly tell you what\n",
      "they are.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“And, upon my word, they have an air of great probability. Mr. Dixon's\n",
      "preference of her music to her friend's, I can answer for being very\n",
      "decided.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“And then, he saved her life. Did you ever hear of that?--A water\n",

      "\n",
      "“Were you really?--Well!--But you observed nothing of course, for it\n",

      "her.--It was the work of a moment. And though the consequent shock and\n",
      "alarm was very great and much more durable--indeed I believe it was\n",
      "half an hour before any of us were comfortable again--yet that was too\n",

      "was again safely covered, when every corner dish was placed exactly\n",
      "right, and occupation and ease were generally restored, Emma said,\n",

      "\n",
      "“Indeed you injure me if you suppose me unconvinced. Your reasonings\n",
      "carry my judgment along with them entirely. At first, while I supposed\n",
      "you satisfied that Colonel Campbell was the giver, I saw it only as\n",
      "paternal kindness, and thought it the most natural thing in the world.\n",
      "But when you mentioned Mrs. Dixon, I felt how much more probable that it\n",
      "should be the tribute of warm female friendship. And now I can see it in\n",
      "no other light than as an offering of love.”\n",
      "\n",
      "There was no occasion to press the matter farther. The conviction seemed\n",
      "real; he looked as if he felt it. She said no more, other subjects\n",
      "took their turn; and the rest of the dinner passed away; the dessert\n",
      "succeeded, the children came in, and were talked to and admired amid the\n",
      "usual rate of conversation; a few clever things said, a few downright\n",
      "silly, but by much the larger proportion neither the one nor the\n",
      "other--nothing worse than everyday remarks, dull repetitions, old news,\n",
      "and heavy jokes.\n",
      "\n",
      "The ladies had not been long in the drawing-room, before the other\n",
      "ladies, in their different divisions, arrived. Emma watched the entree\n",
      "of her own particular little friend; and if she could not exult in her\n",
      "dignity and grace, she could not only love the blooming sweetness and\n",
      "the artless manner, but could most heartily rejoice in that light,\n",
      "cheerful, unsentimental disposition which allowed her so many\n",
      "alleviations of pleasure, in the midst of the pangs of disappointed\n",
      "affection. There she sat--and who would have guessed how many tears she\n",
      "had been lately shedding? To be in company, nicely dressed herself and\n",
      "seeing others nicely dressed, to sit and smile and look pretty, and say\n",
      "nothing, was enough for the happiness of the present hour. Jane Fairfax\n",
      "did look and move superior; but Emma suspected she might have been\n",
      "glad to change feelings with Harriet, very glad to have purchased the\n",
      "mortification of having loved--yes, of having loved even Mr. Elton in\n",
      "vain--by the surrender of all the dangerous pleasure of knowing herself\n",
      "beloved by the husband of her friend.\n",
      "\n",
      "In so large a party it was not necessary that Emma should approach her.\n",
      "She did not wish to speak of the pianoforte, she felt too much in the\n",
      "secret herself, to think the appearance of curiosity or interest fair,\n",
      "and therefore purposely kept at a distance; but by the others, the\n",
      "subject was almost immediately introduced, and she saw the blush of\n",
      "consciousness with which congratulations were received, the blush\n",
      "of guilt which accompanied the name of “my excellent friend Colonel\n",
      "Campbell.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Weston, kind-hearted and musical, was particularly interested\n",
      "by the circumstance, and Emma could not help being amused at her\n",
      "perseverance in dwelling on the subject; and having so much to ask and\n",
      "to say as to tone, touch, and pedal, totally unsuspicious of that wish\n",
      "of saying as little about it as possible, which she plainly read in the\n",
      "fair heroine's countenance.\n",
      "\n",
      "They were soon joined by some of the gentlemen; and the very first\n",
      "of the early was Frank Churchill. In he walked, the first and the\n",
      "handsomest; and after paying his compliments en passant to Miss Bates\n",
      "and her niece, made his way directly to the opposite side of the circle,\n",
      "where sat Miss Woodhouse; and till he could find a seat by her, would\n",
      "not sit at all. Emma divined what every body present must be thinking.\n",
      "She was his object, and every body must perceive it. She introduced him\n",
      "to her friend, Miss Smith, and, at convenient moments afterwards, heard\n",
      "what each thought of the other. “He had never seen so lovely a face, and\n",
      "was delighted with her naivete.” And she, “Only to be sure it was paying\n",
      "him too great a compliment, but she did think there were some looks a\n",
      "little like Mr. Elton.” Emma restrained her indignation, and only turned\n",
      "from her in silence.\n",
      "\n",
      "Smiles of intelligence passed between her and the gentleman on first\n",
      "glancing towards Miss Fairfax; but it was most prudent to avoid speech.\n",
      "He told her that he had been impatient to leave the dining-room--hated\n",
      "sitting long--was always the first to move when he could--that his\n",
      "father, Mr. Knightley, Mr. Cox, and Mr. Cole, were left very busy over\n",
      "parish business--that as long as he had staid, however, it had been\n",
      "pleasant enough, as he had found them in general a set of gentlemanlike,\n",
      "sensible men; and spoke so handsomely of Highbury altogether--thought it\n",
      "so abundant in agreeable families--that Emma began to feel she had been\n",
      "used to despise the place rather too much. She questioned him as to the\n",
      "society in Yorkshire--the extent of the neighbourhood about Enscombe,\n",
      "and the sort; and could make out from his answers that, as far as\n",
      "Enscombe was concerned, there was very little going on, that their\n",
      "visitings were among a range of great families, none very near; and\n",
      "that even when days were fixed, and invitations accepted, it was an even\n",
      "chance that Mrs. Churchill were not in health and spirits for going;\n",
      "that they made a point of visiting no fresh person; and that, though\n",
      "he had his separate engagements, it was not without difficulty, without\n",
      "considerable address _at_ _times_, that he could get away, or introduce\n",
      "an acquaintance for a night.\n",
      "\n",
      "She saw that Enscombe could not satisfy, and that Highbury, taken at\n",
      "its best, might reasonably please a young man who had more retirement at\n",
      "home than he liked. His importance at Enscombe was very evident. He did\n",
      "not boast, but it naturally betrayed itself, that he had persuaded his\n",
      "aunt where his uncle could do nothing, and on her laughing and noticing\n",
      "it, he owned that he believed (excepting one or two points) he could\n",
      "_with_ _time_ persuade her to any thing. One of those points on which\n",
      "his influence failed, he then mentioned. He had wanted very much to\n",
      "go abroad--had been very eager indeed to be allowed to travel--but she\n",
      "would not hear of it. This had happened the year before. _Now_, he said,\n",
      "he was beginning to have no longer the same wish.\n",
      "\n",
      "The unpersuadable point, which he did not mention, Emma guessed to be\n",
      "good behaviour to his father.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I have made a most wretched discovery,” said he, after a short pause.--\n",
      "“I have been here a week to-morrow--half my time. I never knew days fly\n",
      "so fast. A week to-morrow!--And I have hardly begun to enjoy myself.\n",
      "But just got acquainted with Mrs. Weston, and others!--I hate the\n",
      "recollection.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Perhaps you may now begin to regret that you spent one whole day, out\n",
      "of so few, in having your hair cut.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No,” said he, smiling, “that is no subject of regret at all. I have\n",
      "no pleasure in seeing my friends, unless I can believe myself fit to be\n",
      "seen.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The rest of the gentlemen being now in the room, Emma found herself\n",
      "obliged to turn from him for a few minutes, and listen to Mr. Cole. When\n",
      "Mr. Cole had moved away, and her attention could be restored as before,\n",
      "she saw Frank Churchill looking intently across the room at Miss\n",
      "Fairfax, who was sitting exactly opposite.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What is the matter?” said she.\n",
      "\n",
      "He started. “Thank you for rousing me,” he replied. “I believe I have\n",
      "been very rude; but really Miss Fairfax has done her hair in so odd a\n",
      "way--so very odd a way--that I cannot keep my eyes from her. I never saw\n",
      "any thing so outree!--Those curls!--This must be a fancy of her own. I\n",
      "see nobody else looking like her!--I must go and ask her whether it\n",
      "is an Irish fashion. Shall I?--Yes, I will--I declare I will--and you\n",
      "shall see how she takes it;--whether she colours.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He was gone immediately; and Emma soon saw him standing before Miss\n",
      "Fairfax, and talking to her; but as to its effect on the young lady,\n",
      "as he had improvidently placed himself exactly between them, exactly in\n",
      "front of Miss Fairfax, she could absolutely distinguish nothing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Before he could return to his chair, it was taken by Mrs. Weston.\n",
      "\n",
      "“This is the luxury of a large party,” said she:--“one can get near\n",
      "every body, and say every thing. My dear Emma, I am longing to talk\n",
      "to you. I have been making discoveries and forming plans, just like\n",
      "yourself, and I must tell them while the idea is fresh. Do you know how\n",
      "Miss Bates and her niece came here?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“How?--They were invited, were not they?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh! yes--but how they were conveyed hither?--the manner of their\n",
      "coming?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“They walked, I conclude. How else could they come?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Very true.--Well, a little while ago it occurred to me how very sad\n",
      "it would be to have Jane Fairfax walking home again, late at night, and\n",
      "cold as the nights are now. And as I looked at her, though I never saw\n",
      "her appear to more advantage, it struck me that she was heated, and\n",
      "would therefore be particularly liable to take cold. Poor girl! I could\n",
      "not bear the idea of it; so, as soon as Mr. Weston came into the room,\n",
      "and I could get at him, I spoke to him about the carriage. You may guess\n",
      "how readily he came into my wishes; and having his approbation, I made\n",
      "my way directly to Miss Bates, to assure her that the carriage would be\n",
      "at her service before it took us home; for I thought it would be making\n",
      "her comfortable at once. Good soul! she was as grateful as possible, you\n",
      "may be sure. 'Nobody was ever so fortunate as herself!'--but with many,\n",
      "many thanks--'there was no occasion to trouble us, for Mr. Knightley's\n",
      "carriage had brought, and was to take them home again.' I was quite\n",
      "surprized;--very glad, I am sure; but really quite surprized. Such a\n",
      "very kind attention--and so thoughtful an attention!--the sort of thing\n",
      "that so few men would think of. And, in short, from knowing his\n",
      "usual ways, I am very much inclined to think that it was for their\n",
      "accommodation the carriage was used at all. I do suspect he would not\n",
      "have had a pair of horses for himself, and that it was only as an excuse\n",
      "for assisting them.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Very likely,” said Emma--“nothing more likely. I know no man more\n",
      "likely than Mr. Knightley to do the sort of thing--to do any thing\n",
      "really good-natured, useful, considerate, or benevolent. He is not a\n",
      "gallant man, but he is a very humane one; and this, considering Jane\n",
      "Fairfax's ill-health, would appear a case of humanity to him;--and for\n",
      "an act of unostentatious kindness, there is nobody whom I would fix on\n",
      "more than on Mr. Knightley. I know he had horses to-day--for we arrived\n",
      "together; and I laughed at him about it, but he said not a word that\n",
      "could betray.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well,” said Mrs. Weston, smiling, “you give him credit for more simple,\n",
      "disinterested benevolence in this instance than I do; for while Miss\n",
      "Bates was speaking, a suspicion darted into my head, and I have never\n",
      "been able to get it out again. The more I think of it, the more probable\n",
      "it appears. In short, I have made a match between Mr. Knightley and Jane\n",
      "Fairfax. See the consequence of keeping you company!--What do you say to\n",
      "it?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Mr. Knightley and Jane Fairfax!” exclaimed Emma. “Dear Mrs. Weston, how\n",
      "could you think of such a thing?--Mr. Knightley!--Mr. Knightley must not\n",
      "marry!--You would not have little Henry cut out from Donwell?--Oh! no,\n",
      "no, Henry must have Donwell. I cannot at all consent to Mr. Knightley's\n",
      "marrying; and I am sure it is not at all likely. I am amazed that you\n",
      "should think of such a thing.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“My dear Emma, I have told you what led me to think of it. I do not want\n",
      "the match--I do not want to injure dear little Henry--but the idea has\n",
      "been given me by circumstances; and if Mr. Knightley really wished to\n",
      "marry, you would not have him refrain on Henry's account, a boy of six\n",
      "years old, who knows nothing of the matter?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, I would. I could not bear to have Henry supplanted.--Mr.\n",
      "Knightley marry!--No, I have never had such an idea, and I cannot adopt\n",
      "it now. And Jane Fairfax, too, of all women!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Nay, she has always been a first favourite with him, as you very well\n",
      "know.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But the imprudence of such a match!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I am not speaking of its prudence; merely its probability.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I see no probability in it, unless you have any better foundation than\n",
      "what you mention. His good-nature, his humanity, as I tell you, would\n",
      "be quite enough to account for the horses. He has a great regard for the\n",
      "Bateses, you know, independent of Jane Fairfax--and is always glad to\n",
      "shew them attention. My dear Mrs. Weston, do not take to match-making.\n",
      "You do it very ill. Jane Fairfax mistress of the Abbey!--Oh! no,\n",
      "no;--every feeling revolts. For his own sake, I would not have him do so\n",
      "mad a thing.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Imprudent, if you please--but not mad. Excepting inequality of fortune,\n",
      "and perhaps a little disparity of age, I can see nothing unsuitable.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But Mr. Knightley does not want to marry. I am sure he has not the\n",
      "least idea of it. Do not put it into his head. Why should he marry?--He\n",
      "is as happy as possible by himself; with his farm, and his sheep, and\n",
      "his library, and all the parish to manage; and he is extremely fond of\n",
      "his brother's children. He has no occasion to marry, either to fill up\n",
      "his time or his heart.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“My dear Emma, as long as he thinks so, it is so; but if he really loves\n",
      "Jane Fairfax--”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Nonsense! He does not care about Jane Fairfax. In the way of love, I am\n",
      "sure he does not. He would do any good to her, or her family; but--”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well,” said Mrs. Weston, laughing, “perhaps the greatest good he could\n",
      "do them, would be to give Jane such a respectable home.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“If it would be good to her, I am sure it would be evil to himself; a\n",
      "very shameful and degrading connexion. How would he bear to have Miss\n",
      "Bates belonging to him?--To have her haunting the Abbey, and thanking\n",
      "him all day long for his great kindness in marrying Jane?--'So very\n",
      "kind and obliging!--But he always had been such a very kind neighbour!'\n",
      "And then fly off, through half a sentence, to her mother's old\n",
      "petticoat. 'Not that it was such a very old petticoat either--for still\n",
      "it would last a great while--and, indeed, she must thankfully say that\n",
      "their petticoats were all very strong.'”\n",
      "\n",
      "“For shame, Emma! Do not mimic her. You divert me against my conscience.\n",
      "And, upon my word, I do not think Mr. Knightley would be much disturbed\n",
      "by Miss Bates. Little things do not irritate him. She might talk on; and\n",
      "if he wanted to say any thing himself, he would only talk louder, and\n",
      "drown her voice. But the question is not, whether it would be a bad\n",
      "connexion for him, but whether he wishes it; and I think he does. I have\n",
      "heard him speak, and so must you, so very highly of Jane Fairfax! The\n",
      "interest he takes in her--his anxiety about her health--his concern that\n",
      "she should have no happier prospect! I have heard him express himself\n",
      "so warmly on those points!--Such an admirer of her performance on the\n",
      "pianoforte, and of her voice! I have heard him say that he could listen\n",
      "to her for ever. Oh! and I had almost forgotten one idea that occurred\n",
      "to me--this pianoforte that has been sent here by somebody--though\n",
      "we have all been so well satisfied to consider it a present from the\n",
      "Campbells, may it not be from Mr. Knightley? I cannot help suspecting\n",
      "him. I think he is just the person to do it, even without being in\n",
      "love.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Then it can be no argument to prove that he is in love. But I do not\n",
      "think it is at all a likely thing for him to do. Mr. Knightley does\n",
      "nothing mysteriously.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I have heard him lamenting her having no instrument repeatedly; oftener\n",
      "than I should suppose such a circumstance would, in the common course of\n",
      "things, occur to him.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Very well; and if he had intended to give her one, he would have told\n",
      "her so.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“There might be scruples of delicacy, my dear Emma. I have a very strong\n",
      "notion that it comes from him. I am sure he was particularly silent when\n",
      "Mrs. Cole told us of it at dinner.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You take up an idea, Mrs. Weston, and run away with it; as you have\n",
      "many a time reproached me with doing. I see no sign of attachment--I\n",
      "believe nothing of the pianoforte--and proof only shall convince me that\n",
      "Mr. Knightley has any thought of marrying Jane Fairfax.”\n",
      "\n",
      "They combated the point some time longer in the same way; Emma rather\n",
      "gaining ground over the mind of her friend; for Mrs. Weston was the most\n",
      "used of the two to yield; till a little bustle in the room shewed them\n",
      "that tea was over, and the instrument in preparation;--and at the same\n",
      "moment Mr. Cole approaching to entreat Miss Woodhouse would do them the\n",
      "honour of trying it. Frank Churchill, of whom, in the eagerness of her\n",
      "conversation with Mrs. Weston, she had been seeing nothing, except that\n",
      "he had found a seat by Miss Fairfax, followed Mr. Cole, to add his very\n",
      "pressing entreaties; and as, in every respect, it suited Emma best to\n",
      "lead, she gave a very proper compliance.\n",
      "\n",
      "She knew the limitations of her own powers too well to attempt more than\n",
      "she could perform with credit; she wanted neither taste nor spirit in\n",
      "the little things which are generally acceptable, and could accompany\n",
      "her own voice well. One accompaniment to her song took her agreeably by\n",
      "surprize--a second, slightly but correctly taken by Frank Churchill. Her\n",
      "pardon was duly begged at the close of the song, and every thing usual\n",
      "followed. He was accused of having a delightful voice, and a perfect\n",
      "knowledge of music; which was properly denied; and that he knew nothing\n",
      "of the matter, and had no voice at all, roundly asserted. They sang\n",
      "together once more; and Emma would then resign her place to Miss\n",
      "Fairfax, whose performance, both vocal and instrumental, she never could\n",
      "attempt to conceal from herself, was infinitely superior to her own.\n",
      "\n",
      "With mixed feelings, she seated herself at a little distance from the\n",
      "numbers round the instrument, to listen. Frank Churchill sang again.\n",
      "They had sung together once or twice, it appeared, at Weymouth. But the\n",
      "sight of Mr. Knightley among the most attentive, soon drew away half\n",
      "Emma's mind; and she fell into a train of thinking on the subject of\n",
      "Mrs. Weston's suspicions, to which the sweet sounds of the united voices\n",
      "gave only momentary interruptions. Her objections to Mr. Knightley's\n",
      "marrying did not in the least subside. She could see nothing but evil\n",
      "in it. It would be a great disappointment to Mr. John Knightley;\n",
      "consequently to Isabella. A real injury to the children--a most\n",
      "mortifying change, and material loss to them all;--a very great\n",
      "deduction from her father's daily comfort--and, as to herself, she could\n",
      "not at all endure the idea of Jane Fairfax at Donwell Abbey. A Mrs.\n",
      "Knightley for them all to give way to!--No--Mr. Knightley must never\n",
      "marry. Little Henry must remain the heir of Donwell.\n",
      "\n",
      "Presently Mr. Knightley looked back, and came and sat down by her. They\n",
      "talked at first only of the performance. His admiration was certainly\n",
      "very warm; yet she thought, but for Mrs. Weston, it would not have\n",
      "struck her. As a sort of touchstone, however, she began to speak of his\n",
      "kindness in conveying the aunt and niece; and though his answer was in\n",
      "the spirit of cutting the matter short, she believed it to indicate only\n",
      "his disinclination to dwell on any kindness of his own.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I often feel concern,” said she, “that I dare not make our carriage\n",
      "more useful on such occasions. It is not that I am without the wish; but\n",
      "you know how impossible my father would deem it that James should put-to\n",
      "for such a purpose.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Quite out of the question, quite out of the question,” he\n",
      "replied;--“but you must often wish it, I am sure.” And he smiled with\n",
      "such seeming pleasure at the conviction, that she must proceed another\n",
      "step.\n",
      "\n",
      "“This present from the Campbells,” said she--“this pianoforte is very\n",
      "kindly given.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes,” he replied, and without the smallest apparent\n",
      "embarrassment.--“But they would have done better had they given\n",
      "her notice of it. Surprizes are foolish things. The pleasure is not\n",
      "enhanced, and the inconvenience is often considerable. I should have\n",
      "expected better judgment in Colonel Campbell.”\n",
      "\n",
      "From that moment, Emma could have taken her oath that Mr. Knightley had\n",
      "had no concern in giving the instrument. But whether he were\n",
      "entirely free from peculiar attachment--whether there were no actual\n",
      "preference--remained a little longer doubtful. Towards the end of Jane's\n",
      "second song, her voice grew thick.\n",
      "\n",
      "“That will do,” said he, when it was finished, thinking aloud--“you have\n",
      "sung quite enough for one evening--now be quiet.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Another song, however, was soon begged for. “One more;--they would not\n",
      "fatigue Miss Fairfax on any account, and would only ask for one more.”\n",
      " And Frank Churchill was heard to say, “I think you could manage this\n",
      "without effort; the first part is so very trifling. The strength of the\n",
      "song falls on the second.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Knightley grew angry.\n",
      "\n",
      "“That fellow,” said he, indignantly, “thinks of nothing but shewing off\n",
      "his own voice. This must not be.” And touching Miss Bates, who at that\n",
      "moment passed near--“Miss Bates, are you mad, to let your niece sing\n",
      "herself hoarse in this manner? Go, and interfere. They have no mercy on\n",
      "her.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Miss Bates, in her real anxiety for Jane, could hardly stay even to\n",
      "be grateful, before she stept forward and put an end to all farther\n",
      "singing. Here ceased the concert part of the evening, for Miss Woodhouse\n",
      "and Miss Fairfax were the only young lady performers; but soon (within\n",
      "five minutes) the proposal of dancing--originating nobody exactly knew\n",
      "where--was so effectually promoted by Mr. and Mrs. Cole, that every\n",
      "thing was rapidly clearing away, to give proper space. Mrs. Weston,\n",
      "capital in her country-dances, was seated, and beginning an irresistible\n",
      "waltz; and Frank Churchill, coming up with most becoming gallantry to\n",
      "Emma, had secured her hand, and led her up to the top.\n",
      "\n",
      "While waiting till the other young people could pair themselves off,\n",
      "Emma found time, in spite of the compliments she was receiving on\n",
      "her voice and her taste, to look about, and see what became of Mr.\n",
      "Knightley. This would be a trial. He was no dancer in general. If he\n",
      "were to be very alert in engaging Jane Fairfax now, it might augur\n",
      "something. There was no immediate appearance. No; he was talking to Mrs.\n",
      "Cole--he was looking on unconcerned; Jane was asked by somebody else,\n",
      "and he was still talking to Mrs. Cole.\n",
      "\n",
      "Emma had no longer an alarm for Henry; his interest was yet safe; and\n",
      "she led off the dance with genuine spirit and enjoyment. Not more than\n",
      "five couple could be mustered; but the rarity and the suddenness of\n",
      "it made it very delightful, and she found herself well matched in a\n",
      "partner. They were a couple worth looking at.\n",
      "\n",
      "Two dances, unfortunately, were all that could be allowed. It was\n",
      "growing late, and Miss Bates became anxious to get home, on her mother's\n",
      "account. After some attempts, therefore, to be permitted to begin again,\n",
      "they were obliged to thank Mrs. Weston, look sorrowful, and have done.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Perhaps it is as well,” said Frank Churchill, as he attended Emma to\n",
      "her carriage. “I must have asked Miss Fairfax, and her languid dancing\n",
      "would not have agreed with me, after yours.”\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Emma did not repent her condescension in going to the Coles. The visit\n",
      "afforded her many pleasant recollections the next day; and all that she\n",
      "might be supposed to have lost on the side of dignified seclusion, must\n",
      "be amply repaid in the splendour of popularity. She must have delighted\n",
      "the Coles--worthy people, who deserved to be made happy!--And left a\n",
      "name behind her that would not soon die away.\n",
      "\n",
      "Perfect happiness, even in memory, is not common; and there were two\n",
      "points on which she was not quite easy. She doubted whether she had not\n",
      "transgressed the duty of woman by woman, in betraying her suspicions of\n",
      "Jane Fairfax's feelings to Frank Churchill. It was hardly right; but it\n",
      "had been so strong an idea, that it would escape her, and his submission\n",
      "to all that she told, was a compliment to her penetration, which made\n",
      "it difficult for her to be quite certain that she ought to have held her\n",
      "tongue.\n",
      "\n",
      "The other circumstance of regret related also to Jane Fairfax; and\n",
      "there she had no doubt. She did unfeignedly and unequivocally regret the\n",
      "inferiority of her own playing and singing. She did most heartily\n",
      "grieve over the idleness of her childhood--and sat down and practised\n",
      "vigorously an hour and a half.\n",
      "\n",
      "She was then interrupted by Harriet's coming in; and if Harriet's praise\n",
      "could have satisfied her, she might soon have been comforted.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh! if I could but play as well as you and Miss Fairfax!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Don't class us together, Harriet. My playing is no more like her's,\n",
      "than a lamp is like sunshine.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh! dear--I think you play the best of the two. I think you play quite\n",
      "as well as she does. I am sure I had much rather hear you. Every body\n",
      "last night said how well you played.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Those who knew any thing about it, must have felt the difference. The\n",
      "truth is, Harriet, that my playing is just good enough to be praised,\n",
      "but Jane Fairfax's is much beyond it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, I always shall think that you play quite as well as she does, or\n",
      "that if there is any difference nobody would ever find it out. Mr. Cole\n",
      "said how much taste you had; and Mr. Frank Churchill talked a great deal\n",
      "about your taste, and that he valued taste much more than execution.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ah! but Jane Fairfax has them both, Harriet.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Are you sure? I saw she had execution, but I did not know she had any\n",
      "taste. Nobody talked about it. And I hate Italian singing.--There is no\n",
      "understanding a word of it. Besides, if she does play so very well, you\n",
      "know, it is no more than she is obliged to do, because she will have to\n",
      "teach. The Coxes were wondering last night whether she would get into\n",
      "any great family. How did you think the Coxes looked?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Just as they always do--very vulgar.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“They told me something,” said Harriet rather hesitatingly; “but it is\n",
      "nothing of any consequence.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Emma was obliged to ask what they had told her, though fearful of its\n",
      "producing Mr. Elton.\n",
      "\n",
      "“They told me--that Mr. Martin dined with them last Saturday.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“He came to their father upon some business, and he asked him to stay to\n",
      "dinner.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“They talked a great deal about him, especially Anne Cox. I do not know\n",
      "what she meant, but she asked me if I thought I should go and stay there\n",
      "again next summer.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“She meant to be impertinently curious, just as such an Anne Cox should\n",
      "be.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“She said he was very agreeable the day he dined there. He sat by her at\n",
      "dinner. Miss Nash thinks either of the Coxes would be very glad to marry\n",
      "him.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Very likely.--I think they are, without exception, the most vulgar\n",
      "girls in Highbury.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Harriet had business at Ford's.--Emma thought it most prudent to go with\n",
      "her. Another accidental meeting with the Martins was possible, and in\n",
      "her present state, would be dangerous.\n",
      "\n",
      "Harriet, tempted by every thing and swayed by half a word, was always\n",
      "very long at a purchase; and while she was still hanging over muslins\n",
      "and changing her mind, Emma went to the door for amusement.--Much could\n",
      "not be hoped from the traffic of even the busiest part of Highbury;--Mr.\n",
      "Perry walking hastily by, Mr. William Cox letting himself in at the\n",
      "office-door, Mr. Cole's carriage-horses returning from exercise, or a\n",
      "stray letter-boy on an obstinate mule, were the liveliest objects she\n",
      "could presume to expect; and when her eyes fell only on the butcher with\n",
      "his tray, a tidy old woman travelling homewards from shop with her full\n",
      "basket, two curs quarrelling over a dirty bone, and a string of dawdling\n",
      "children round the baker's little bow-window eyeing the gingerbread, she\n",
      "knew she had no reason to complain, and was amused enough; quite enough\n",
      "still to stand at the door. A mind lively and at ease, can do with\n",
      "seeing nothing, and can see nothing that does not answer.\n",
      "\n",
      "She looked down the Randalls road. The scene enlarged; two persons\n",
      "appeared; Mrs. Weston and her son-in-law; they were walking into\n",
      "Highbury;--to Hartfield of course. They were stopping, however, in the\n",
      "first place at Mrs. Bates's; whose house was a little nearer\n",
      "Randalls than Ford's; and had all but knocked, when Emma caught their\n",
      "eye.--Immediately they crossed the road and came forward to her; and the\n",
      "agreeableness of yesterday's engagement seemed to give fresh pleasure to\n",
      "the present meeting. Mrs. Weston informed her that she was going to call\n",
      "on the Bateses, in order to hear the new instrument.\n",
      "\n",
      "“For my companion tells me,” said she, “that I absolutely promised Miss\n",
      "Bates last night, that I would come this morning. I was not aware of it\n",
      "myself. I did not know that I had fixed a day, but as he says I did, I\n",
      "am going now.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“And while Mrs. Weston pays her visit, I may be allowed, I hope,” said\n",
      "Frank Churchill, “to join your party and wait for her at Hartfield--if\n",
      "you are going home.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Weston was disappointed.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I thought you meant to go with me. They would be very much pleased.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Me! I should be quite in the way. But, perhaps--I may be equally in the\n",
      "way here. Miss Woodhouse looks as if she did not want me. My aunt always\n",
      "sends me off when she is shopping. She says I fidget her to death; and\n",
      "Miss Woodhouse looks as if she could almost say the same. What am I to\n",
      "do?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I am here on no business of my own,” said Emma; “I am only waiting for\n",
      "my friend. She will probably have soon done, and then we shall go home.\n",
      "But you had better go with Mrs. Weston and hear the instrument.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well--if you advise it.--But (with a smile) if Colonel Campbell should\n",
      "have employed a careless friend, and if it should prove to have an\n",
      "indifferent tone--what shall I say? I shall be no support to Mrs.\n",
      "Weston. She might do very well by herself. A disagreeable truth would be\n",
      "palatable through her lips, but I am the wretchedest being in the world\n",
      "at a civil falsehood.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I do not believe any such thing,” replied Emma.--“I am persuaded that\n",
      "you can be as insincere as your neighbours, when it is necessary; but\n",
      "there is no reason to suppose the instrument is indifferent. Quite\n",
      "otherwise indeed, if I understood Miss Fairfax's opinion last night.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Do come with me,” said Mrs. Weston, “if it be not very disagreeable to\n",
      "you. It need not detain us long. We will go to Hartfield afterwards.\n",
      "We will follow them to Hartfield. I really wish you to call with me. It\n",
      "will be felt so great an attention! and I always thought you meant it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He could say no more; and with the hope of Hartfield to reward him,\n",
      "returned with Mrs. Weston to Mrs. Bates's door. Emma watched them in,\n",
      "and then joined Harriet at the interesting counter,--trying, with all\n",
      "the force of her own mind, to convince her that if she wanted plain\n",
      "muslin it was of no use to look at figured; and that a blue ribbon, be\n",
      "it ever so beautiful, would still never match her yellow pattern. At\n",
      "last it was all settled, even to the destination of the parcel.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Should I send it to Mrs. Goddard's, ma'am?” asked Mrs.\n",
      "Ford.--“Yes--no--yes, to Mrs. Goddard's. Only my pattern gown is at\n",
      "Hartfield. No, you shall send it to Hartfield, if you please. But then,\n",
      "Mrs. Goddard will want to see it.--And I could take the pattern gown\n",
      "home any day. But I shall want the ribbon directly--so it had better go\n",
      "to Hartfield--at least the ribbon. You could make it into two parcels,\n",
      "Mrs. Ford, could not you?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It is not worth while, Harriet, to give Mrs. Ford the trouble of two\n",
      "parcels.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No more it is.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No trouble in the world, ma'am,” said the obliging Mrs. Ford.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh! but indeed I would much rather have it only in one. Then, if you\n",
      "please, you shall send it all to Mrs. Goddard's--I do not know--No, I\n",
      "think, Miss Woodhouse, I may just as well have it sent to Hartfield, and\n",
      "take it home with me at night. What do you advise?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“That you do not give another half-second to the subject. To Hartfield,\n",
      "if you please, Mrs. Ford.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Aye, that will be much best,” said Harriet, quite satisfied, “I should\n",

      "Weston and Miss Bates met them at the door.\n",
      "\n",
      "“My dear Miss Woodhouse,” said the latter, “I am just run across to\n",
      "entreat the favour of you to come and sit down with us a little while,\n",
      "and give us your opinion of our new instrument; you and Miss Smith. How\n",
      "do you do, Miss Smith?--Very well I thank you.--And I begged Mrs. Weston\n",
      "to come with me, that I might be sure of succeeding.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I hope Mrs. Bates and Miss Fairfax are--”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Very well, I am much obliged to you. My mother is delightfully well;\n",
      "and Jane caught no cold last night. How is Mr. Woodhouse?--I am so glad\n",
      "to hear such a good account. Mrs. Weston told me you were here.--Oh!\n",
      "then, said I, I must run across, I am sure Miss Woodhouse will allow me\n",
      "just to run across and entreat her to come in; my mother will be so\n",
      "very happy to see her--and now we are such a nice party, she cannot\n",
      "refuse.--'Aye, pray do,' said Mr. Frank Churchill, 'Miss Woodhouse's\n",
      "opinion of the instrument will be worth having.'--But, said I, I shall\n",
      "be more sure of succeeding if one of you will go with me.--'Oh,' said\n",
      "he, 'wait half a minute, till I have finished my job;'--For, would you\n",
      "believe it, Miss Woodhouse, there he is, in the most obliging manner in\n",
      "the world, fastening in the rivet of my mother's spectacles.--The rivet\n",
      "came out, you know, this morning.--So very obliging!--For my mother had\n",
      "no use of her spectacles--could not put them on. And, by the bye, every\n",
      "body ought to have two pair of spectacles; they should indeed. Jane said\n",
      "so. I meant to take them over to John Saunders the first thing I did,\n",
      "but something or other hindered me all the morning; first one thing,\n",
      "then another, there is no saying what, you know. At one time Patty came\n",
      "to say she thought the kitchen chimney wanted sweeping. Oh, said I,\n",
      "Patty do not come with your bad news to me. Here is the rivet of your\n",
      "mistress's spectacles out. Then the baked apples came home, Mrs. Wallis\n",
      "sent them by her boy; they are extremely civil and obliging to us, the\n",
      "Wallises, always--I have heard some people say that Mrs. Wallis can be\n",
      "uncivil and give a very rude answer, but we have never known any thing\n",
      "but the greatest attention from them. And it cannot be for the value\n",
      "of our custom now, for what is our consumption of bread, you know?\n",
      "Only three of us.--besides dear Jane at present--and she really eats\n",
      "nothing--makes such a shocking breakfast, you would be quite frightened\n",
      "if you saw it. I dare not let my mother know how little she eats--so I\n",
      "say one thing and then I say another, and it passes off. But about the\n",
      "middle of the day she gets hungry, and there is nothing she likes so\n",
      "well as these baked apples, and they are extremely wholesome, for I took\n",
      "the opportunity the other day of asking Mr. Perry; I happened to meet\n",
      "him in the street. Not that I had any doubt before--I have so often\n",
      "heard Mr. Woodhouse recommend a baked apple. I believe it is the only\n",
      "way that Mr. Woodhouse thinks the fruit thoroughly wholesome. We\n",
      "have apple-dumplings, however, very often. Patty makes an excellent\n",
      "apple-dumpling. Well, Mrs. Weston, you have prevailed, I hope, and these\n",
      "ladies will oblige us.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Emma would be “very happy to wait on Mrs. Bates, &c.,” and they did at\n",
      "last move out of the shop, with no farther delay from Miss Bates than,\n",
      "\n",
      "“How do you do, Mrs. Ford? I beg your pardon. I did not see you before.\n",
      "I hear you have a charming collection of new ribbons from town. Jane\n",
      "came back delighted yesterday. Thank ye, the gloves do very well--only a\n",
      "little too large about the wrist; but Jane is taking them in.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“What was I talking of?” said she, beginning again when they were all in\n",
      "the street.\n",
      "\n",
      "Emma wondered on what, of all the medley, she would fix.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I declare I cannot recollect what I was talking of.--Oh! my mother's\n",
      "spectacles. So very obliging of Mr. Frank Churchill! 'Oh!' said he,\n",
      "'I do think I can fasten the rivet; I like a job of this kind\n",
      "excessively.'--Which you know shewed him to be so very.... Indeed I must\n",
      "say that, much as I had heard of him before and much as I had expected,\n",
      "he very far exceeds any thing.... I do congratulate you, Mrs. Weston,\n",
      "most warmly. He seems every thing the fondest parent could....\n",
      "'Oh!' said he, 'I can fasten the rivet. I like a job of that sort\n",
      "excessively.' I never shall forget his manner. And when I brought out\n",
      "the baked apples from the closet, and hoped our friends would be so very\n",
      "obliging as to take some, 'Oh!' said he directly, 'there is nothing\n",
      "in the way of fruit half so good, and these are the finest-looking\n",
      "home-baked apples I ever saw in my life.' That, you know, was so\n",
      "very.... And I am sure, by his manner, it was no compliment. Indeed they\n",
      "are very delightful apples, and Mrs. Wallis does them full justice--only\n",
      "we do not have them baked more than twice, and Mr. Woodhouse made us\n",
      "promise to have them done three times--but Miss Woodhouse will be so\n",
      "good as not to mention it. The apples themselves are the very finest\n",
      "sort for baking, beyond a doubt; all from Donwell--some of Mr.\n",
      "Knightley's most liberal supply. He sends us a sack every year; and\n",
      "certainly there never was such a keeping apple anywhere as one of his\n",
      "trees--I believe there is two of them. My mother says the orchard was\n",
      "always famous in her younger days. But I was really quite shocked the\n",
      "other day--for Mr. Knightley called one morning, and Jane was eating\n",
      "these apples, and we talked about them and said how much she enjoyed\n",
      "them, and he asked whether we were not got to the end of our stock. 'I\n",
      "am sure you must be,' said he, 'and I will send you another supply; for\n",
      "I have a great many more than I can ever use. William Larkins let me\n",
      "keep a larger quantity than usual this year. I will send you some more,\n",
      "before they get good for nothing.' So I begged he would not--for really\n",
      "as to ours being gone, I could not absolutely say that we had a great\n",
      "many left--it was but half a dozen indeed; but they should be all kept\n",
      "for Jane; and I could not at all bear that he should be sending us more,\n",
      "so liberal as he had been already; and Jane said the same. And when\n",
      "he was gone, she almost quarrelled with me--No, I should not say\n",
      "quarrelled, for we never had a quarrel in our lives; but she was quite\n",
      "distressed that I had owned the apples were so nearly gone; she wished\n",
      "I had made him believe we had a great many left. Oh, said I, my dear,\n",
      "I did say as much as I could. However, the very same evening William\n",
      "Larkins came over with a large basket of apples, the same sort of\n",
      "apples, a bushel at least, and I was very much obliged, and went down\n",
      "and spoke to William Larkins and said every thing, as you may suppose.\n",
      "William Larkins is such an old acquaintance! I am always glad to see\n",
      "him. But, however, I found afterwards from Patty, that William said it\n",
      "was all the apples of _that_ sort his master had; he had brought them\n",
      "all--and now his master had not one left to bake or boil. William did\n",
      "not seem to mind it himself, he was so pleased to think his master had\n",
      "sold so many; for William, you know, thinks more of his master's profit\n",
      "than any thing; but Mrs. Hodges, he said, was quite displeased at their\n",
      "being all sent away. She could not bear that her master should not be\n",
      "able to have another apple-tart this spring. He told Patty this, but bid\n",
      "her not mind it, and be sure not to say any thing to us about it, for\n",
      "Mrs. Hodges _would_ be cross sometimes, and as long as so many sacks\n",
      "were sold, it did not signify who ate the remainder. And so Patty told\n",
      "me, and I was excessively shocked indeed! I would not have Mr. Knightley\n",
      "know any thing about it for the world! He would be so very.... I wanted\n",
      "to keep it from Jane's knowledge; but, unluckily, I had mentioned it\n",
      "before I was aware.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Miss Bates had just done as Patty opened the door; and her visitors\n",
      "walked upstairs without having any regular narration to attend to,\n",
      "pursued only by the sounds of her desultory good-will.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Pray take care, Mrs. Weston, there is a step at the turning. Pray take\n",
      "care, Miss Woodhouse, ours is rather a dark staircase--rather darker\n",
      "and narrower than one could wish. Miss Smith, pray take care. Miss\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The appearance of the little sitting-room as they entered, was\n",
      "tranquillity itself; Mrs. Bates, deprived of her usual employment,\n",
      "slumbering on one side of the fire, Frank Churchill, at a table near\n",
      "her, most deedily occupied about her spectacles, and Jane Fairfax,\n",
      "standing with her back to them, intent on her pianoforte.\n",
      "\n",
      "Busy as he was, however, the young man was yet able to shew a most happy\n",
      "countenance on seeing Emma again.\n",
      "\n",
      "“This is a pleasure,” said he, in rather a low voice, “coming at least\n",
      "ten minutes earlier than I had calculated. You find me trying to be\n",
      "useful; tell me if you think I shall succeed.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“What!” said Mrs. Weston, “have not you finished it yet? you would not\n",
      "earn a very good livelihood as a working silversmith at this rate.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I have not been working uninterruptedly,” he replied, “I have been\n",
      "assisting Miss Fairfax in trying to make her instrument stand steadily,\n",
      "it was not quite firm; an unevenness in the floor, I believe. You see\n",
      "we have been wedging one leg with paper. This was very kind of you to be\n",
      "persuaded to come. I was almost afraid you would be hurrying home.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He contrived that she should be seated by him; and was sufficiently\n",
      "employed in looking out the best baked apple for her, and trying to make\n",
      "her help or advise him in his work, till Jane Fairfax was quite ready\n",
      "to sit down to the pianoforte again. That she was not immediately ready,\n",
      "Emma did suspect to arise from the state of her nerves; she had not yet\n",
      "possessed the instrument long enough to touch it without emotion; she\n",
      "must reason herself into the power of performance; and Emma could not\n",
      "but pity such feelings, whatever their origin, and could not but resolve\n",
      "never to expose them to her neighbour again.\n",
      "\n",
      "At last Jane began, and though the first bars were feebly given, the\n",
      "powers of the instrument were gradually done full justice to. Mrs.\n",
      "Weston had been delighted before, and was delighted again; Emma\n",
      "joined her in all her praise; and the pianoforte, with every proper\n",
      "discrimination, was pronounced to be altogether of the highest promise.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Whoever Colonel Campbell might employ,” said Frank Churchill, with a\n",
      "smile at Emma, “the person has not chosen ill. I heard a good deal of\n",
      "Colonel Campbell's taste at Weymouth; and the softness of the upper\n",
      "notes I am sure is exactly what he and _all_ _that_ _party_ would\n",
      "particularly prize. I dare say, Miss Fairfax, that he either gave his\n",
      "friend very minute directions, or wrote to Broadwood himself. Do not you\n",
      "think so?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Jane did not look round. She was not obliged to hear. Mrs. Weston had\n",
      "been speaking to her at the same moment.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It is not fair,” said Emma, in a whisper; “mine was a random guess. Do\n",
      "not distress her.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He shook his head with a smile, and looked as if he had very little\n",
      "doubt and very little mercy. Soon afterwards he began again,\n",
      "\n",
      "“How much your friends in Ireland must be enjoying your pleasure on this\n",
      "occasion, Miss Fairfax. I dare say they often think of you, and wonder\n",
      "which will be the day, the precise day of the instrument's coming to\n",
      "hand. Do you imagine Colonel Campbell knows the business to be going\n",
      "forward just at this time?--Do you imagine it to be the consequence\n",
      "of an immediate commission from him, or that he may have sent only\n",
      "a general direction, an order indefinite as to time, to depend upon\n",
      "contingencies and conveniences?”\n",
      "\n",
      "He paused. She could not but hear; she could not avoid answering,\n",
      "\n",
      "“Till I have a letter from Colonel Campbell,” said she, in a voice of\n",
      "forced calmness, “I can imagine nothing with any confidence. It must be\n",
      "all conjecture.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Conjecture--aye, sometimes one conjectures right, and sometimes one\n",
      "conjectures wrong. I wish I could conjecture how soon I shall make this\n",
      "rivet quite firm. What nonsense one talks, Miss Woodhouse, when hard\n",
      "at work, if one talks at all;--your real workmen, I suppose, hold their\n",
      "tongues; but we gentlemen labourers if we get hold of a word--Miss\n",
      "Fairfax said something about conjecturing. There, it is done. I have the\n",
      "pleasure, madam, (to Mrs. Bates,) of restoring your spectacles, healed\n",
      "for the present.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He was very warmly thanked both by mother and daughter; to escape a\n",
      "little from the latter, he went to the pianoforte, and begged Miss\n",
      "Fairfax, who was still sitting at it, to play something more.\n",
      "\n",
      "“If you are very kind,” said he, “it will be one of the waltzes we\n",
      "danced last night;--let me live them over again. You did not enjoy them\n",
      "as I did; you appeared tired the whole time. I believe you were glad we\n",
      "danced no longer; but I would have given worlds--all the worlds one ever\n",
      "has to give--for another half-hour.”\n",
      "\n",
      "She played.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What felicity it is to hear a tune again which _has_ made one\n",
      "happy!--If I mistake not that was danced at Weymouth.”\n",
      "\n",
      "She looked up at him for a moment, coloured deeply, and played something\n",
      "else. He took some music from a chair near the pianoforte, and turning\n",
      "to Emma, said,\n",
      "\n",
      "“Here is something quite new to me. Do you know it?--Cramer.--And here\n",
      "are a new set of Irish melodies. That, from such a quarter, one might\n",
      "expect. This was all sent with the instrument. Very thoughtful of\n",
      "Colonel Campbell, was not it?--He knew Miss Fairfax could have no music\n",
      "here. I honour that part of the attention particularly; it shews it to\n",
      "have been so thoroughly from the heart. Nothing hastily done; nothing\n",
      "incomplete. True affection only could have prompted it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Emma wished he would be less pointed, yet could not help being amused;\n",
      "and when on glancing her eye towards Jane Fairfax she caught the remains\n",
      "of a smile, when she saw that with all the deep blush of consciousness,\n",
      "there had been a smile of secret delight, she had less scruple in the\n",
      "amusement, and much less compunction with respect to her.--This\n",
      "amiable, upright, perfect Jane Fairfax was apparently cherishing very\n",
      "reprehensible feelings.\n",
      "\n",
      "He brought all the music to her, and they looked it over together.--Emma\n",
      "took the opportunity of whispering,\n",
      "\n",
      "“You speak too plain. She must understand you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I hope she does. I would have her understand me. I am not in the least\n",
      "ashamed of my meaning.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But really, I am half ashamed, and wish I had never taken up the idea.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I am very glad you did, and that you communicated it to me. I have now\n",
      "a key to all her odd looks and ways. Leave shame to her. If she does\n",
      "wrong, she ought to feel it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“She is not entirely without it, I think.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I do not see much sign of it. She is playing _Robin_ _Adair_ at this\n",
      "moment--_his_ favourite.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Shortly afterwards Miss Bates, passing near the window, descried Mr.\n",
      "Knightley on horse-back not far off.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Mr. Knightley I declare!--I must speak to him if possible, just to\n",
      "thank him. I will not open the window here; it would give you all cold;\n",
      "but I can go into my mother's room you know. I dare say he will come\n",
      "in when he knows who is here. Quite delightful to have you all meet\n",
      "so!--Our little room so honoured!”\n",
      "\n",
      "She was in the adjoining chamber while she still spoke, and opening the\n",
      "casement there, immediately called Mr. Knightley's attention, and every\n",
      "syllable of their conversation was as distinctly heard by the others, as\n",
      "if it had passed within the same apartment.\n",
      "\n",
      "“How d' ye do?--how d'ye do?--Very well, I thank you. So obliged to you\n",
      "for the carriage last night. We were just in time; my mother just ready\n",
      "for us. Pray come in; do come in. You will find some friends here.”\n",
      "\n",
      "So began Miss Bates; and Mr. Knightley seemed determined to be heard in\n",
      "his turn, for most resolutely and commandingly did he say,\n",
      "\n",
      "“How is your niece, Miss Bates?--I want to inquire after you all, but\n",
      "particularly your niece. How is Miss Fairfax?--I hope she caught no cold\n",
      "last night. How is she to-day? Tell me how Miss Fairfax is.”\n",
      "\n",
      "And Miss Bates was obliged to give a direct answer before he would hear\n",
      "her in any thing else. The listeners were amused; and Mrs. Weston gave\n",
      "Emma a look of particular meaning. But Emma still shook her head in\n",
      "steady scepticism.\n",
      "\n",
      "“So obliged to you!--so very much obliged to you for the carriage,”\n",
      " resumed Miss Bates.\n",
      "\n",
      "He cut her short with,\n",
      "\n",
      "“I am going to Kingston. Can I do any thing for you?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh! dear, Kingston--are you?--Mrs. Cole was saying the other day she\n",
      "wanted something from Kingston.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Mrs. Cole has servants to send. Can I do any thing for _you_?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No, I thank you. But do come in. Who do you think is here?--Miss\n",
      "Woodhouse and Miss Smith; so kind as to call to hear the new pianoforte.\n",
      "Do put up your horse at the Crown, and come in.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well,” said he, in a deliberating manner, “for five minutes, perhaps.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“And here is Mrs. Weston and Mr. Frank Churchill too!--Quite delightful;\n",
      "so many friends!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No, not now, I thank you. I could not stay two minutes. I must get on\n",
      "to Kingston as fast as I can.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh! do come in. They will be so very happy to see you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No, no; your room is full enough. I will call another day, and hear the\n",

      "\n",
      "“Well, I am so sorry!--Oh! Mr. Knightley, what a delightful party last\n",
      "night; how extremely pleasant.--Did you ever see such dancing?--Was not\n",
      "it delightful?--Miss Woodhouse and Mr. Frank Churchill; I never saw any\n",
      "thing equal to it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh! very delightful indeed; I can say nothing less, for I suppose Miss\n",
      "Woodhouse and Mr. Frank Churchill are hearing every thing that passes.\n",
      "And (raising his voice still more) I do not see why Miss Fairfax should\n",
      "not be mentioned too. I think Miss Fairfax dances very well; and Mrs.\n",
      "Weston is the very best country-dance player, without exception,\n",
      "in England. Now, if your friends have any gratitude, they will say\n",
      "something pretty loud about you and me in return; but I cannot stay to\n",
      "hear it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh! Mr. Knightley, one moment more; something of consequence--so\n",
      "shocked!--Jane and I are both so shocked about the apples!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“What is the matter now?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“To think of your sending us all your store apples. You said you had\n",
      "a great many, and now you have not one left. We really are so shocked!\n",
      "Mrs. Hodges may well be angry. William Larkins mentioned it here. You\n",
      "should not have done it, indeed you should not. Ah! he is off. He never\n",
      "can bear to be thanked. But I thought he would have staid now, and it\n",
      "would have been a pity not to have mentioned.... Well, (returning to the\n",

      "“Yes,” said Jane, “we heard his kind offers, we heard every thing.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh! yes, my dear, I dare say you might, because you know, the door was\n",
      "open, and the window was open, and Mr. Knightley spoke loud. You must\n",
      "have heard every thing to be sure. 'Can I do any thing for you at\n",
      "Kingston?' said he; so I just mentioned.... Oh! Miss Woodhouse, must you\n",

      "Emma found it really time to be at home; the visit had already lasted\n",
      "long; and on examining watches, so much of the morning was perceived\n",
      "to be gone, that Mrs. Weston and her companion taking leave also, could\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "It may be possible to do without dancing entirely. Instances have been\n",
      "known of young people passing many, many months successively, without\n",
      "being at any ball of any description, and no material injury accrue\n",
      "either to body or mind;--but when a beginning is made--when the\n",
      "felicities of rapid motion have once been, though slightly, felt--it\n",
      "must be a very heavy set that does not ask for more.\n",
      "\n",
      "Frank Churchill had danced once at Highbury, and longed to dance again;\n",
      "and the last half-hour of an evening which Mr. Woodhouse was persuaded\n",
      "to spend with his daughter at Randalls, was passed by the two young\n",
      "people in schemes on the subject. Frank's was the first idea; and his\n",
      "the greatest zeal in pursuing it; for the lady was the best judge of the\n",
      "difficulties, and the most solicitous for accommodation and appearance.\n",
      "But still she had inclination enough for shewing people again how\n",
      "delightfully Mr. Frank Churchill and Miss Woodhouse danced--for\n",
      "doing that in which she need not blush to compare herself with Jane\n",
      "Fairfax--and even for simple dancing itself, without any of the wicked\n",
      "aids of vanity--to assist him first in pacing out the room they were in\n",
      "to see what it could be made to hold--and then in taking the dimensions\n",
      "of the other parlour, in the hope of discovering, in spite of all that\n",
      "Mr. Weston could say of their exactly equal size, that it was a little\n",
      "the largest.\n",
      "\n",
      "His first proposition and request, that the dance begun at Mr. Cole's\n",
      "should be finished there--that the same party should be collected,\n",
      "and the same musician engaged, met with the readiest acquiescence. Mr.\n",
      "Weston entered into the idea with thorough enjoyment, and Mrs. Weston\n",
      "most willingly undertook to play as long as they could wish to dance;\n",
      "and the interesting employment had followed, of reckoning up exactly who\n",
      "there would be, and portioning out the indispensable division of space\n",
      "to every couple.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You and Miss Smith, and Miss Fairfax, will be three, and the two Miss\n",
      "Coxes five,” had been repeated many times over. “And there will be the\n",
      "two Gilberts, young Cox, my father, and myself, besides Mr. Knightley.\n",
      "Yes, that will be quite enough for pleasure. You and Miss Smith, and\n",
      "Miss Fairfax, will be three, and the two Miss Coxes five; and for five\n",
      "couple there will be plenty of room.”\n",
      "\n",
      "But soon it came to be on one side,\n",
      "\n",
      "“But will there be good room for five couple?--I really do not think\n",
      "there will.”\n",
      "\n",
      "On another,\n",
      "\n",
      "“And after all, five couple are not enough to make it worth while to\n",
      "stand up. Five couple are nothing, when one thinks seriously about it.\n",
      "It will not do to _invite_ five couple. It can be allowable only as the\n",
      "thought of the moment.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Somebody said that _Miss_ Gilbert was expected at her brother's, and\n",
      "must be invited with the rest. Somebody else believed _Mrs_. Gilbert\n",
      "would have danced the other evening, if she had been asked. A word was\n",
      "put in for a second young Cox; and at last, Mr. Weston naming one family\n",
      "of cousins who must be included, and another of very old acquaintance\n",
      "who could not be left out, it became a certainty that the five couple\n",
      "would be at least ten, and a very interesting speculation in what\n",
      "possible manner they could be disposed of.\n",
      "\n",
      "The doors of the two rooms were just opposite each other. “Might not\n",
      "they use both rooms, and dance across the passage?” It seemed the\n",
      "best scheme; and yet it was not so good but that many of them wanted a\n",
      "better. Emma said it would be awkward; Mrs. Weston was in distress about\n",
      "the supper; and Mr. Woodhouse opposed it earnestly, on the score of\n",
      "health. It made him so very unhappy, indeed, that it could not be\n",
      "persevered in.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh! no,” said he; “it would be the extreme of imprudence. I could not\n",
      "bear it for Emma!--Emma is not strong. She would catch a dreadful cold.\n",
      "So would poor little Harriet. So you would all. Mrs. Weston, you would\n",
      "be quite laid up; do not let them talk of such a wild thing. Pray do\n",
      "not let them talk of it. That young man (speaking lower) is very\n",
      "thoughtless. Do not tell his father, but that young man is not quite\n",
      "the thing. He has been opening the doors very often this evening,\n",
      "and keeping them open very inconsiderately. He does not think of the\n",
      "draught. I do not mean to set you against him, but indeed he is not\n",
      "quite the thing!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Weston was sorry for such a charge. She knew the importance of\n",
      "it, and said every thing in her power to do it away. Every door was now\n",
      "closed, the passage plan given up, and the first scheme of dancing only\n",
      "in the room they were in resorted to again; and with such good-will on\n",
      "Frank Churchill's part, that the space which a quarter of an hour before\n",
      "had been deemed barely sufficient for five couple, was now endeavoured\n",
      "to be made out quite enough for ten.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We were too magnificent,” said he. “We allowed unnecessary room. Ten\n",
      "couple may stand here very well.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Emma demurred. “It would be a crowd--a sad crowd; and what could be\n",
      "worse than dancing without space to turn in?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Very true,” he gravely replied; “it was very bad.” But still he went on\n",
      "measuring, and still he ended with,\n",
      "\n",
      "“I think there will be very tolerable room for ten couple.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No, no,” said she, “you are quite unreasonable. It would be dreadful\n",
      "to be standing so close! Nothing can be farther from pleasure than to be\n",
      "dancing in a crowd--and a crowd in a little room!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“There is no denying it,” he replied. “I agree with you exactly. A crowd\n",
      "in a little room--Miss Woodhouse, you have the art of giving pictures\n",
      "in a few words. Exquisite, quite exquisite!--Still, however, having\n",
      "proceeded so far, one is unwilling to give the matter up. It would be\n",
      "a disappointment to my father--and altogether--I do not know that--I am\n",
      "rather of opinion that ten couple might stand here very well.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Emma perceived that the nature of his gallantry was a little\n",
      "self-willed, and that he would rather oppose than lose the pleasure of\n",
      "dancing with her; but she took the compliment, and forgave the rest.\n",
      "Had she intended ever to _marry_ him, it might have been worth while to\n",
      "pause and consider, and try to understand the value of his preference,\n",
      "and the character of his temper; but for all the purposes of their\n",
      "acquaintance, he was quite amiable enough.\n",
      "\n",
      "Before the middle of the next day, he was at Hartfield; and he entered\n",
      "the room with such an agreeable smile as certified the continuance of\n",
      "the scheme. It soon appeared that he came to announce an improvement.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, Miss Woodhouse,” he almost immediately began, “your inclination\n",
      "for dancing has not been quite frightened away, I hope, by the terrors\n",
      "of my father's little rooms. I bring a new proposal on the subject:--a\n",
      "thought of my father's, which waits only your approbation to be acted\n",
      "upon. May I hope for the honour of your hand for the two first dances\n",
      "of this little projected ball, to be given, not at Randalls, but at the\n",
      "Crown Inn?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“The Crown!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes; if you and Mr. Woodhouse see no objection, and I trust you cannot,\n",
      "my father hopes his friends will be so kind as to visit him there.\n",
      "Better accommodations, he can promise them, and not a less grateful\n",
      "welcome than at Randalls. It is his own idea. Mrs. Weston sees no\n",
      "objection to it, provided you are satisfied. This is what we all feel.\n",
      "Oh! you were perfectly right! Ten couple, in either of the Randalls\n",
      "rooms, would have been insufferable!--Dreadful!--I felt how right you\n",
      "were the whole time, but was too anxious for securing _any_ _thing_\n",
      "to like to yield. Is not it a good exchange?--You consent--I hope you\n",
      "consent?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It appears to me a plan that nobody can object to, if Mr. and Mrs.\n",
      "Weston do not. I think it admirable; and, as far as I can answer for\n",
      "myself, shall be most happy--It seems the only improvement that could\n",
      "be. Papa, do you not think it an excellent improvement?”\n",
      "\n",
      "She was obliged to repeat and explain it, before it was fully\n",
      "comprehended; and then, being quite new, farther representations were\n",
      "necessary to make it acceptable.\n",
      "\n",
      "“No; he thought it very far from an improvement--a very bad plan--much\n",
      "worse than the other. A room at an inn was always damp and dangerous;\n",
      "never properly aired, or fit to be inhabited. If they must dance, they\n",
      "had better dance at Randalls. He had never been in the room at the Crown\n",
      "in his life--did not know the people who kept it by sight.--Oh! no--a\n",
      "very bad plan. They would catch worse colds at the Crown than anywhere.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I was going to observe, sir,” said Frank Churchill, “that one of the\n",
      "great recommendations of this change would be the very little danger\n",
      "of any body's catching cold--so much less danger at the Crown than at\n",
      "Randalls! Mr. Perry might have reason to regret the alteration, but\n",
      "nobody else could.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Sir,” said Mr. Woodhouse, rather warmly, “you are very much mistaken\n",
      "if you suppose Mr. Perry to be that sort of character. Mr. Perry is\n",
      "extremely concerned when any of us are ill. But I do not understand how\n",
      "the room at the Crown can be safer for you than your father's house.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“From the very circumstance of its being larger, sir. We shall have no\n",
      "occasion to open the windows at all--not once the whole evening; and it\n",
      "is that dreadful habit of opening the windows, letting in cold air upon\n",
      "heated bodies, which (as you well know, sir) does the mischief.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Open the windows!--but surely, Mr. Churchill, nobody would think of\n",
      "opening the windows at Randalls. Nobody could be so imprudent! I never\n",
      "heard of such a thing. Dancing with open windows!--I am sure, neither\n",
      "your father nor Mrs. Weston (poor Miss Taylor that was) would suffer\n",
      "it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ah! sir--but a thoughtless young person will sometimes step behind a\n",
      "window-curtain, and throw up a sash, without its being suspected. I have\n",
      "often known it done myself.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Have you indeed, sir?--Bless me! I never could have supposed it. But I\n",
      "live out of the world, and am often astonished at what I hear. However,\n",
      "this does make a difference; and, perhaps, when we come to talk it\n",
      "over--but these sort of things require a good deal of consideration. One\n",
      "cannot resolve upon them in a hurry. If Mr. and Mrs. Weston will be so\n",
      "obliging as to call here one morning, we may talk it over, and see what\n",
      "can be done.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But, unfortunately, sir, my time is so limited--”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh!” interrupted Emma, “there will be plenty of time for talking every\n",
      "thing over. There is no hurry at all. If it can be contrived to be at\n",
      "the Crown, papa, it will be very convenient for the horses. They will be\n",
      "so near their own stable.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“So they will, my dear. That is a great thing. Not that James ever\n",
      "complains; but it is right to spare our horses when we can. If I could\n",
      "be sure of the rooms being thoroughly aired--but is Mrs. Stokes to be\n",
      "trusted? I doubt it. I do not know her, even by sight.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I can answer for every thing of that nature, sir, because it will be\n",
      "under Mrs. Weston's care. Mrs. Weston undertakes to direct the whole.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“There, papa!--Now you must be satisfied--Our own dear Mrs. Weston, who\n",
      "is carefulness itself. Do not you remember what Mr. Perry said, so many\n",
      "years ago, when I had the measles? 'If _Miss_ _Taylor_ undertakes to\n",
      "wrap Miss Emma up, you need not have any fears, sir.' How often have I\n",
      "heard you speak of it as such a compliment to her!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Aye, very true. Mr. Perry did say so. I shall never forget it. Poor\n",
      "little Emma! You were very bad with the measles; that is, you would have\n",
      "been very bad, but for Perry's great attention. He came four times a day\n",
      "for a week. He said, from the first, it was a very good sort--which\n",
      "was our great comfort; but the measles are a dreadful complaint. I hope\n",
      "whenever poor Isabella's little ones have the measles, she will send for\n",
      "Perry.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“My father and Mrs. Weston are at the Crown at this moment,” said Frank\n",
      "Churchill, “examining the capabilities of the house. I left them there\n",
      "and came on to Hartfield, impatient for your opinion, and hoping you\n",
      "might be persuaded to join them and give your advice on the spot. I was\n",
      "desired to say so from both. It would be the greatest pleasure to\n",
      "them, if you could allow me to attend you there. They can do nothing\n",
      "satisfactorily without you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Emma was most happy to be called to such a council; and her father,\n",
      "engaging to think it all over while she was gone, the two young people\n",
      "set off together without delay for the Crown. There were Mr. and Mrs.\n",
      "Weston; delighted to see her and receive her approbation, very busy and\n",
      "very happy in their different way; she, in some little distress; and he,\n",
      "finding every thing perfect.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Emma,” said she, “this paper is worse than I expected. Look! in places\n",
      "you see it is dreadfully dirty; and the wainscot is more yellow and\n",
      "forlorn than any thing I could have imagined.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“My dear, you are too particular,” said her husband. “What does all that\n",
      "signify? You will see nothing of it by candlelight. It will be as\n",
      "clean as Randalls by candlelight. We never see any thing of it on our\n",
      "club-nights.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The ladies here probably exchanged looks which meant, “Men never know\n",
      "when things are dirty or not;” and the gentlemen perhaps thought each to\n",
      "himself, “Women will have their little nonsenses and needless cares.”\n",
      "\n",
      "One perplexity, however, arose, which the gentlemen did not disdain.\n",
      "It regarded a supper-room. At the time of the ballroom's being built,\n",
      "suppers had not been in question; and a small card-room adjoining, was\n",
      "the only addition. What was to be done? This card-room would be wanted\n",
      "as a card-room now; or, if cards were conveniently voted unnecessary\n",
      "by their four selves, still was it not too small for any comfortable\n",
      "supper? Another room of much better size might be secured for the\n",
      "purpose; but it was at the other end of the house, and a long awkward\n",
      "passage must be gone through to get at it. This made a difficulty. Mrs.\n",
      "Weston was afraid of draughts for the young people in that passage;\n",
      "and neither Emma nor the gentlemen could tolerate the prospect of being\n",
      "miserably crowded at supper.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Weston proposed having no regular supper; merely sandwiches,\n",
      "&c., set out in the little room; but that was scouted as a wretched\n",
      "suggestion. A private dance, without sitting down to supper, was\n",
      "pronounced an infamous fraud upon the rights of men and women; and\n",
      "Mrs. Weston must not speak of it again. She then took another line of\n",
      "expediency, and looking into the doubtful room, observed,\n",
      "\n",
      "“I do not think it _is_ so very small. We shall not be many, you know.”\n",
      "\n",
      "And Mr. Weston at the same time, walking briskly with long steps through\n",
      "the passage, was calling out,\n",
      "\n",
      "“You talk a great deal of the length of this passage, my dear. It is a\n",
      "mere nothing after all; and not the least draught from the stairs.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I wish,” said Mrs. Weston, “one could know which arrangement our guests\n",
      "in general would like best. To do what would be most generally pleasing\n",
      "must be our object--if one could but tell what that would be.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, very true,” cried Frank, “very true. You want your neighbours'\n",
      "opinions. I do not wonder at you. If one could ascertain what the chief\n",
      "of them--the Coles, for instance. They are not far off. Shall I call\n",
      "upon them? Or Miss Bates? She is still nearer.--And I do not know\n",
      "whether Miss Bates is not as likely to understand the inclinations of\n",
      "the rest of the people as any body. I think we do want a larger council.\n",
      "Suppose I go and invite Miss Bates to join us?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well--if you please,” said Mrs. Weston rather hesitating, “if you think\n",
      "she will be of any use.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You will get nothing to the purpose from Miss Bates,” said Emma. “She\n",
      "will be all delight and gratitude, but she will tell you nothing. She\n",
      "will not even listen to your questions. I see no advantage in consulting\n",
      "Miss Bates.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But she is so amusing, so extremely amusing! I am very fond of hearing\n",
      "Miss Bates talk. And I need not bring the whole family, you know.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Here Mr. Weston joined them, and on hearing what was proposed, gave it\n",
      "his decided approbation.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Aye, do, Frank.--Go and fetch Miss Bates, and let us end the matter at\n",
      "once. She will enjoy the scheme, I am sure; and I do not know a properer\n",
      "person for shewing us how to do away difficulties. Fetch Miss Bates.\n",
      "We are growing a little too nice. She is a standing lesson of how to be\n",
      "happy. But fetch them both. Invite them both.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Both sir! Can the old lady?”...\n",
      "\n",
      "“The old lady! No, the young lady, to be sure. I shall think you a great\n",
      "blockhead, Frank, if you bring the aunt without the niece.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh! I beg your pardon, sir. I did not immediately recollect.\n",
      "Undoubtedly if you wish it, I will endeavour to persuade them both.” And\n",
      "away he ran.\n",
      "\n",
      "Long before he reappeared, attending the short, neat, brisk-moving aunt,\n",
      "and her elegant niece,--Mrs. Weston, like a sweet-tempered woman and\n",
      "a good wife, had examined the passage again, and found the evils of it\n",
      "much less than she had supposed before--indeed very trifling; and here\n",
      "ended the difficulties of decision. All the rest, in speculation at\n",
      "least, was perfectly smooth. All the minor arrangements of table and\n",
      "chair, lights and music, tea and supper, made themselves; or were left\n",
      "as mere trifles to be settled at any time between Mrs. Weston and Mrs.\n",
      "Stokes.--Every body invited, was certainly to come; Frank had already\n",
      "written to Enscombe to propose staying a few days beyond his fortnight,\n",
      "which could not possibly be refused. And a delightful dance it was to\n",
      "be.\n",
      "\n",
      "Most cordially, when Miss Bates arrived, did she agree that it must.\n",
      "As a counsellor she was not wanted; but as an approver, (a much safer\n",
      "character,) she was truly welcome. Her approbation, at once general\n",
      "and minute, warm and incessant, could not but please; and for another\n",
      "half-hour they were all walking to and fro, between the different rooms,\n",
      "some suggesting, some attending, and all in happy enjoyment of the\n",
      "future. The party did not break up without Emma's being positively\n",
      "secured for the two first dances by the hero of the evening, nor without\n",
      "her overhearing Mr. Weston whisper to his wife, “He has asked her, my\n",
      "dear. That's right. I knew he would!”\n",

      "term of Frank Churchill's stay in Surry; for, in spite of Mr. Weston's\n",
      "confidence, she could not think it so very impossible that the\n",
      "Churchills might not allow their nephew to remain a day beyond his\n",
      "fortnight. But this was not judged feasible. The preparations must take\n",
      "their time, nothing could be properly ready till the third week were\n",
      "entered on, and for a few days they must be planning, proceeding and\n",
      "hoping in uncertainty--at the risk--in her opinion, the great risk, of\n",
      "its being all in vain.\n",
      "\n",
      "Enscombe however was gracious, gracious in fact, if not in word. His\n",
      "wish of staying longer evidently did not please; but it was not opposed.\n",
      "All was safe and prosperous; and as the removal of one solicitude\n",
      "generally makes way for another, Emma, being now certain of her\n",
      "ball, began to adopt as the next vexation Mr. Knightley's provoking\n",
      "indifference about it. Either because he did not dance himself, or\n",
      "because the plan had been formed without his being consulted, he\n",
      "seemed resolved that it should not interest him, determined against its\n",
      "exciting any present curiosity, or affording him any future amusement.\n",
      "To her voluntary communications Emma could get no more approving reply,\n",
      "than,\n",

      "against it, but that they shall not chuse pleasures for me.--Oh! yes,\n",
      "I must be there; I could not refuse; and I will keep as much awake as\n",
      "I can; but I would rather be at home, looking over William Larkins's\n",
      "week's account; much rather, I confess.--Pleasure in seeing\n",
      "dancing!--not I, indeed--I never look at it--I do not know who\n",
      "does.--Fine dancing, I believe, like virtue, must be its own reward.\n",
      "Those who are standing by are usually thinking of something very\n",
      "different.”\n",
      "\n",
      "This Emma felt was aimed at her; and it made her quite angry. It was not\n",
      "in compliment to Jane Fairfax however that he was so indifferent, or so\n",
      "indignant; he was not guided by _her_ feelings in reprobating the ball,\n",
      "for _she_ enjoyed the thought of it to an extraordinary degree. It made\n",

      "_very_ great pleasure.”\n",
      "\n",
      "It was not to oblige Jane Fairfax therefore that he would have preferred\n",
      "the society of William Larkins. No!--she was more and more convinced\n",
      "that Mrs. Weston was quite mistaken in that surmise. There was a great\n",
      "deal of friendly and of compassionate attachment on his side--but no\n",
      "love.\n",

      "Alas! there was soon no leisure for quarrelling with Mr. Knightley. Two\n",
      "days of joyful security were immediately followed by the over-throw of\n",
      "every thing. A letter arrived from Mr. Churchill to urge his nephew's\n",
      "instant return. Mrs. Churchill was unwell--far too unwell to do without\n",
      "him; she had been in a very suffering state (so said her husband)\n",
      "when writing to her nephew two days before, though from her usual\n",
      "unwillingness to give pain, and constant habit of never thinking of\n",
      "herself, she had not mentioned it; but now she was too ill to trifle,\n",
      "and must entreat him to set off for Enscombe without delay.\n",
      "\n",
      "The substance of this letter was forwarded to Emma, in a note from Mrs.\n",
      "Weston, instantly. As to his going, it was inevitable. He must be gone\n",
      "within a few hours, though without feeling any real alarm for his aunt,\n",
      "to lessen his repugnance. He knew her illnesses; they never occurred but\n",
      "for her own convenience.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Weston added, “that he could only allow himself time to hurry to\n",
      "Highbury, after breakfast, and take leave of the few friends there\n",

      "expected at Hartfield very soon.”\n",
      "\n",
      "This wretched note was the finale of Emma's breakfast. When once it had\n",
      "been read, there was no doing any thing, but lament and exclaim. The\n",
      "loss of the ball--the loss of the young man--and all that the young man\n",
      "might be feeling!--It was too wretched!--Such a delightful evening as\n",
      "it would have been!--Every body so happy! and she and her partner the\n",
      "happiest!--“I said it would be so,” was the only consolation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Her father's feelings were quite distinct. He thought principally of\n",
      "Mrs. Churchill's illness, and wanted to know how she was treated; and as\n",

      "would all be safer at home.\n",
      "\n",
      "Emma was ready for her visitor some time before he appeared; but if this\n",
      "reflected at all upon his impatience, his sorrowful look and total want\n",
      "of spirits when he did come might redeem him. He felt the going away\n",
      "almost too much to speak of it. His dejection was most evident. He\n",
      "sat really lost in thought for the first few minutes; and when rousing\n",
      "himself, it was only to say,\n",
      "\n",
      "“Of all horrid things, leave-taking is the worst.”\n",

      "why are you always so right?”\n",

      "“Such a fortnight as it has been!” he continued; “every day more\n",
      "precious and more delightful than the day before!--every day making\n",
      "me less fit to bear any other place. Happy those, who can remain at\n",
      "Highbury!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“As you do us such ample justice now,” said Emma, laughing, “I will\n",
      "venture to ask, whether you did not come a little doubtfully at first?\n",
      "Do not we rather surpass your expectations? I am sure we do. I am sure\n",
      "you did not much expect to like us. You would not have been so long in\n",
      "coming, if you had had a pleasant idea of Highbury.”\n",

      "was convinced that it had been so.\n",
      "\n",
      "“And you must be off this very morning?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes; my father is to join me here: we shall walk back together, and I\n",

      "him.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Not five minutes to spare even for your friends Miss Fairfax and Miss\n",

      "strengthened yours.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes--I _have_ called there; passing the door, I thought it better. It\n",
      "was a right thing to do. I went in for three minutes, and was detained\n",
      "by Miss Bates's being absent. She was out; and I felt it impossible not\n",
      "to wait till she came in. She is a woman that one may, that one _must_\n",
      "laugh at; but that one would not wish to slight. It was better to pay my\n",
      "visit, then”--\n",
      "\n",
      "He hesitated, got up, walked to a window.\n",
      "\n",
      "“In short,” said he, “perhaps, Miss Woodhouse--I think you can hardly be\n",
      "quite without suspicion”--\n",
      "\n",
      "He looked at her, as if wanting to read her thoughts. She hardly knew\n",
      "what to say. It seemed like the forerunner of something absolutely\n",
      "serious, which she did not wish. Forcing herself to speak, therefore, in\n",
      "the hope of putting it by, she calmly said,\n",
      "\n",
      "“You are quite in the right; it was most natural to pay your visit,\n",
      "then”--\n",
      "\n",
      "He was silent. She believed he was looking at her; probably reflecting\n",
      "on what she had said, and trying to understand the manner. She heard\n",
      "him sigh. It was natural for him to feel that he had _cause_ to sigh.\n",
      "He could not believe her to be encouraging him. A few awkward moments\n",
      "passed, and he sat down again; and in a more determined manner said,\n",
      "\n",
      "“It was something to feel that all the rest of my time might be given to\n",
      "Hartfield. My regard for Hartfield is most warm”--\n",
      "\n",
      "He stopt again, rose again, and seemed quite embarrassed.--He was more\n",
      "in love with her than Emma had supposed; and who can say how it might\n",
      "have ended, if his father had not made his appearance? Mr. Woodhouse\n",
      "soon followed; and the necessity of exertion made him composed.\n",
      "\n",
      "A very few minutes more, however, completed the present trial. Mr.\n",
      "Weston, always alert when business was to be done, and as incapable of\n",
      "procrastinating any evil that was inevitable, as of foreseeing any that\n",
      "was doubtful, said, “It was time to go;” and the young man, though he\n",
      "might and did sigh, could not but agree, to take leave.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I shall hear about you all,” said he; “that is my chief consolation.\n",
      "I shall hear of every thing that is going on among you. I have engaged\n",
      "Mrs. Weston to correspond with me. She has been so kind as to promise\n",
      "it. Oh! the blessing of a female correspondent, when one is really\n",
      "interested in the absent!--she will tell me every thing. In her letters\n",
      "I shall be at dear Highbury again.”\n",
      "\n",
      "A very friendly shake of the hand, a very earnest “Good-bye,” closed the\n",
      "speech, and the door had soon shut out Frank Churchill. Short had been\n",
      "the notice--short their meeting; he was gone; and Emma felt so sorry\n",
      "to part, and foresaw so great a loss to their little society from his\n",
      "absence as to begin to be afraid of being too sorry, and feeling it too\n",
      "much.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was a sad change. They had been meeting almost every day since his\n",
      "arrival. Certainly his being at Randalls had given great spirit to\n",
      "the last two weeks--indescribable spirit; the idea, the expectation\n",
      "of seeing him which every morning had brought, the assurance of his\n",
      "attentions, his liveliness, his manners! It had been a very happy\n",
      "fortnight, and forlorn must be the sinking from it into the common\n",
      "course of Hartfield days. To complete every other recommendation, he had\n",
      "_almost_ told her that he loved her. What strength, or what constancy of\n",
      "affection he might be subject to, was another point; but at present\n",
      "she could not doubt his having a decidedly warm admiration, a conscious\n",
      "preference of herself; and this persuasion, joined to all the rest,\n",
      "made her think that she _must_ be a little in love with him, in spite of\n",
      "every previous determination against it.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I certainly must,” said she. “This sensation of listlessness,\n",
      "weariness, stupidity, this disinclination to sit down and employ myself,\n",
      "this feeling of every thing's being dull and insipid about the house!--\n",
      "I must be in love; I should be the oddest creature in the world if I\n",
      "were not--for a few weeks at least. Well! evil to some is always good to\n",
      "others. I shall have many fellow-mourners for the ball, if not for Frank\n",
      "Churchill; but Mr. Knightley will be happy. He may spend the evening\n",
      "with his dear William Larkins now if he likes.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Knightley, however, shewed no triumphant happiness. He could not say\n",
      "that he was sorry on his own account; his very cheerful look would have\n",
      "contradicted him if he had; but he said, and very steadily, that he\n",
      "was sorry for the disappointment of the others, and with considerable\n",
      "kindness added,\n",
      "\n",

      "It was some days before she saw Jane Fairfax, to judge of her honest\n",
      "regret in this woeful change; but when they did meet, her composure\n",
      "was odious. She had been particularly unwell, however, suffering from\n",
      "headache to a degree, which made her aunt declare, that had the ball\n",
      "taken place, she did not think Jane could have attended it; and it was\n",

      "\n",
      "Emma continued to entertain no doubt of her being in love. Her ideas\n",
      "only varied as to the how much. At first, she thought it was a good\n",
      "deal; and afterwards, but little. She had great pleasure in hearing\n",
      "Frank Churchill talked of; and, for his sake, greater pleasure than ever\n",
      "in seeing Mr. and Mrs. Weston; she was very often thinking of him, and\n",
      "quite impatient for a letter, that she might know how he was, how were\n",
      "his spirits, how was his aunt, and what was the chance of his coming to\n",
      "Randalls again this spring. But, on the other hand, she could not admit\n",
      "herself to be unhappy, nor, after the first morning, to be less disposed\n",
      "for employment than usual; she was still busy and cheerful; and,\n",
      "pleasing as he was, she could yet imagine him to have faults; and\n",
      "farther, though thinking of him so much, and, as she sat drawing or\n",
      "working, forming a thousand amusing schemes for the progress and close\n",
      "of their attachment, fancying interesting dialogues, and inventing\n",
      "elegant letters; the conclusion of every imaginary declaration on his\n",
      "side was that she _refused_ _him_. Their affection was always to subside\n",
      "into friendship. Every thing tender and charming was to mark their\n",
      "parting; but still they were to part. When she became sensible of this,\n",
      "it struck her that she could not be very much in love; for in spite of\n",
      "her previous and fixed determination never to quit her father, never\n",
      "to marry, a strong attachment certainly must produce more of a struggle\n",
      "than she could foresee in her own feelings.\n",

      "“I do not find myself making any use of the word _sacrifice_,” said\n",

      "there any allusion to making a sacrifice. I do suspect that he is not\n",
      "really necessary to my happiness. So much the better. I certainly will\n",
      "not persuade myself to feel more than I do. I am quite enough in love. I\n",
      "should be sorry to be more.”\n",

      "much in love indeed!--and when he comes again, if his affection\n",
      "continue, I must be on my guard not to encourage it.--It would be most\n",
      "inexcusable to do otherwise, as my own mind is quite made up. Not that I\n",
      "imagine he can think I have been encouraging him hitherto. No, if he\n",
      "had believed me at all to share his feelings, he would not have been\n",
      "so wretched. Could he have thought himself encouraged, his looks and\n",
      "language at parting would have been different.--Still, however, I must\n",
      "be on my guard. This is in the supposition of his attachment continuing\n",
      "what it now is; but I do not know that I expect it will; I do not look\n",
      "upon him to be quite the sort of man--I do not altogether build upon\n",
      "his steadiness or constancy.--His feelings are warm, but I can imagine\n",
      "them rather changeable.--Every consideration of the subject, in short,\n",
      "makes me thankful that my happiness is not more deeply involved.--I\n",
      "shall do very well again after a little while--and then, it will be a\n",

      "she read it with a degree of pleasure and admiration which made her\n",
      "at first shake her head over her own sensations, and think she had\n",
      "undervalued their strength. It was a long, well-written letter, giving\n",
      "the particulars of his journey and of his feelings, expressing all the\n",
      "affection, gratitude, and respect which was natural and honourable,\n",
      "and describing every thing exterior and local that could be supposed\n",
      "attractive, with spirit and precision. No suspicious flourishes now of\n",

      "Weston; and the transition from Highbury to Enscombe, the contrast\n",
      "between the places in some of the first blessings of social life was\n",
      "just enough touched on to shew how keenly it was felt, and how much more\n",
      "might have been said but for the restraints of propriety.--The charm\n",
      "of her own name was not wanting. _Miss_ _Woodhouse_ appeared more than\n",
      "once, and never without a something of pleasing connexion, either a\n",
      "compliment to her taste, or a remembrance of what she had said; and in\n",
      "the very last time of its meeting her eye, unadorned as it was by any\n",
      "such broad wreath of gallantry, she yet could discern the effect of\n",
      "her influence and acknowledge the greatest compliment perhaps of all\n",
      "conveyed. Compressed into the very lowest vacant corner were these\n",
      "words--“I had not a spare moment on Tuesday, as you know, for Miss\n",
      "Woodhouse's beautiful little friend. Pray make my excuses and adieus\n",
      "to her.” This, Emma could not doubt, was all for herself. Harriet was\n",
      "remembered only from being _her_ friend. His information and prospects\n",
      "as to Enscombe were neither worse nor better than had been anticipated;\n",
      "Mrs. Churchill was recovering, and he dared not yet, even in his own\n",
      "imagination, fix a time for coming to Randalls again.\n",
      "\n",
      "Gratifying, however, and stimulative as was the letter in the material\n",
      "part, its sentiments, she yet found, when it was folded up and returned\n",
      "to Mrs. Weston, that it had not added any lasting warmth, that she could\n",
      "still do without the writer, and that he must learn to do without her.\n",
      "Her intentions were unchanged. Her resolution of refusal only grew more\n",
      "interesting by the addition of a scheme for his subsequent consolation\n",
      "and happiness. His recollection of Harriet, and the words which\n",
      "clothed it, the “beautiful little friend,” suggested to her the\n",
      "idea of Harriet's succeeding her in his affections. Was it\n",
      "impossible?--No.--Harriet undoubtedly was greatly his inferior in\n",
      "understanding; but he had been very much struck with the loveliness\n",
      "of her face and the warm simplicity of her manner; and all the\n",
      "probabilities of circumstance and connexion were in her favour.--For\n",
      "Harriet, it would be advantageous and delightful indeed.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I must not dwell upon it,” said she.--“I must not think of it. I know\n",
      "the danger of indulging such speculations. But stranger things have\n",
      "happened; and when we cease to care for each other as we do now, it\n",
      "will be the means of confirming us in that sort of true disinterested\n",
      "friendship which I can already look forward to with pleasure.”\n",
      "\n",
      "It was well to have a comfort in store on Harriet's behalf, though it\n",
      "might be wise to let the fancy touch it seldom; for evil in that quarter\n",
      "was at hand. As Frank Churchill's arrival had succeeded Mr. Elton's\n",
      "engagement in the conversation of Highbury, as the latest interest\n",
      "had entirely borne down the first, so now upon Frank Churchill's\n",
      "disappearance, Mr. Elton's concerns were assuming the most irresistible\n",
      "form.--His wedding-day was named. He would soon be among them again; Mr.\n",
      "Elton and his bride. There was hardly time to talk over the first letter\n",
      "from Enscombe before “Mr. Elton and his bride” was in every body's\n",
      "mouth, and Frank Churchill was forgotten. Emma grew sick at the sound.\n",
      "She had had three weeks of happy exemption from Mr. Elton; and Harriet's\n",
      "mind, she had been willing to hope, had been lately gaining strength.\n",
      "With Mr. Weston's ball in view at least, there had been a great deal of\n",
      "insensibility to other things; but it was now too evident that she had\n",
      "not attained such a state of composure as could stand against the actual\n",
      "approach--new carriage, bell-ringing, and all.\n",
      "\n",
      "Poor Harriet was in a flutter of spirits which required all the\n",
      "reasonings and soothings and attentions of every kind that Emma could\n",
      "give. Emma felt that she could not do too much for her, that Harriet had\n",
      "a right to all her ingenuity and all her patience; but it was heavy work\n",
      "to be for ever convincing without producing any effect, for ever agreed\n",
      "to, without being able to make their opinions the same. Harriet listened\n",
      "submissively, and said “it was very true--it was just as Miss Woodhouse\n",
      "described--it was not worth while to think about them--and she would not\n",
      "think about them any longer” but no change of subject could avail, and\n",
      "the next half-hour saw her as anxious and restless about the Eltons as\n",
      "before. At last Emma attacked her on another ground.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Your allowing yourself to be so occupied and so unhappy about Mr.\n",
      "Elton's marrying, Harriet, is the strongest reproach you can make _me_.\n",
      "You could not give me a greater reproof for the mistake I fell into.\n",
      "It was all my doing, I know. I have not forgotten it, I assure\n",
      "you.--Deceived myself, I did very miserably deceive you--and it will\n",
      "be a painful reflection to me for ever. Do not imagine me in danger of\n",
      "forgetting it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Harriet felt this too much to utter more than a few words of eager\n",
      "exclamation. Emma continued,\n",
      "\n",
      "“I have not said, exert yourself Harriet for my sake; think less, talk\n",
      "less of Mr. Elton for my sake; because for your own sake rather, I\n",
      "would wish it to be done, for the sake of what is more important than my\n",
      "comfort, a habit of self-command in you, a consideration of what is your\n",
      "duty, an attention to propriety, an endeavour to avoid the suspicions of\n",
      "others, to save your health and credit, and restore your tranquillity.\n",
      "These are the motives which I have been pressing on you. They are very\n",
      "important--and sorry I am that you cannot feel them sufficiently to act\n",
      "upon them. My being saved from pain is a very secondary consideration.\n",
      "I want you to save yourself from greater pain. Perhaps I may sometimes\n",
      "have felt that Harriet would not forget what was due--or rather what\n",
      "would be kind by me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "This appeal to her affections did more than all the rest. The idea of\n",
      "wanting gratitude and consideration for Miss Woodhouse, whom she really\n",
      "loved extremely, made her wretched for a while, and when the violence\n",
      "of grief was comforted away, still remained powerful enough to prompt to\n",
      "what was right and support her in it very tolerably.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You, who have been the best friend I ever had in my life--Want\n",
      "gratitude to you!--Nobody is equal to you!--I care for nobody as I do\n",
      "for you!--Oh! Miss Woodhouse, how ungrateful I have been!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Such expressions, assisted as they were by every thing that look and\n",
      "manner could do, made Emma feel that she had never loved Harriet so\n",
      "well, nor valued her affection so highly before.\n",
      "\n",
      "“There is no charm equal to tenderness of heart,” said she afterwards to\n",
      "herself. “There is nothing to be compared to it. Warmth and tenderness\n",
      "of heart, with an affectionate, open manner, will beat all the\n",
      "clearness of head in the world, for attraction, I am sure it will. It\n",
      "is tenderness of heart which makes my dear father so generally\n",
      "beloved--which gives Isabella all her popularity.--I have it not--but\n",
      "I know how to prize and respect it.--Harriet is my superior in all the\n",
      "charm and all the felicity it gives. Dear Harriet!--I would not change\n",
      "you for the clearest-headed, longest-sighted, best-judging female\n",
      "breathing. Oh! the coldness of a Jane Fairfax!--Harriet is worth a\n",
      "hundred such--And for a wife--a sensible man's wife--it is invaluable. I\n",

      "CHAPTER XIV\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Elton was first seen at church: but though devotion might be\n",
      "interrupted, curiosity could not be satisfied by a bride in a pew, and\n",
      "it must be left for the visits in form which were then to be paid, to\n",
      "settle whether she were very pretty indeed, or only rather pretty, or\n",
      "not pretty at all.\n",
      "\n",
      "Emma had feelings, less of curiosity than of pride or propriety, to make\n",
      "her resolve on not being the last to pay her respects; and she made a\n",
      "point of Harriet's going with her, that the worst of the business might\n",
      "be gone through as soon as possible.\n",
      "\n",
      "She could not enter the house again, could not be in the same room to\n",
      "which she had with such vain artifice retreated three months ago, to\n",
      "lace up her boot, without _recollecting_. A thousand vexatious thoughts\n",
      "would recur. Compliments, charades, and horrible blunders; and it was\n",
      "not to be supposed that poor Harriet should not be recollecting too; but\n",
      "she behaved very well, and was only rather pale and silent. The visit\n",
      "was of course short; and there was so much embarrassment and occupation\n",
      "of mind to shorten it, that Emma would not allow herself entirely to\n",
      "form an opinion of the lady, and on no account to give one, beyond the\n",
      "nothing-meaning terms of being “elegantly dressed, and very pleasing.”\n",
      "\n",
      "She did not really like her. She would not be in a hurry to find fault,\n",
      "but she suspected that there was no elegance;--ease, but not elegance.--\n",
      "She was almost sure that for a young woman, a stranger, a bride, there\n",
      "was too much ease. Her person was rather good; her face not unpretty;\n",
      "but neither feature, nor air, nor voice, nor manner, were elegant. Emma\n",
      "thought at least it would turn out so.\n",
      "\n",
      "As for Mr. Elton, his manners did not appear--but no, she would not\n",
      "permit a hasty or a witty word from herself about his manners. It was an\n",
      "awkward ceremony at any time to be receiving wedding visits, and a man\n",
      "had need be all grace to acquit himself well through it. The woman\n",
      "was better off; she might have the assistance of fine clothes, and the\n",
      "privilege of bashfulness, but the man had only his own good sense to\n",
      "depend on; and when she considered how peculiarly unlucky poor Mr.\n",
      "Elton was in being in the same room at once with the woman he had just\n",
      "married, the woman he had wanted to marry, and the woman whom he had\n",
      "been expected to marry, she must allow him to have the right to look as\n",
      "little wise, and to be as much affectedly, and as little really easy as\n",
      "could be.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, Miss Woodhouse,” said Harriet, when they had quitted the\n",
      "house, and after waiting in vain for her friend to begin; “Well, Miss\n",
      "Woodhouse, (with a gentle sigh,) what do you think of her?--Is not she\n",
      "very charming?”\n",
      "\n",
      "There was a little hesitation in Emma's answer.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh! yes--very--a very pleasing young woman.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I think her beautiful, quite beautiful.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Very nicely dressed, indeed; a remarkably elegant gown.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I am not at all surprized that he should have fallen in love.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh! no--there is nothing to surprize one at all.--A pretty fortune; and\n",
      "she came in his way.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I dare say,” returned Harriet, sighing again, “I dare say she was very\n",
      "much attached to him.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Perhaps she might; but it is not every man's fate to marry the woman\n",
      "who loves him best. Miss Hawkins perhaps wanted a home, and thought this\n",
      "the best offer she was likely to have.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes,” said Harriet earnestly, “and well she might, nobody could ever\n",
      "have a better. Well, I wish them happy with all my heart. And now, Miss\n",
      "Woodhouse, I do not think I shall mind seeing them again. He is just as\n",
      "superior as ever;--but being married, you know, it is quite a different\n",
      "thing. No, indeed, Miss Woodhouse, you need not be afraid; I can sit and\n",
      "admire him now without any great misery. To know that he has not thrown\n",
      "himself away, is such a comfort!--She does seem a charming young woman,\n",
      "just what he deserves. Happy creature! He called her 'Augusta.' How\n",
      "delightful!”\n",
      "\n",
      "When the visit was returned, Emma made up her mind. She could then see\n",
      "more and judge better. From Harriet's happening not to be at Hartfield,\n",
      "and her father's being present to engage Mr. Elton, she had a quarter\n",
      "of an hour of the lady's conversation to herself, and could composedly\n",
      "attend to her; and the quarter of an hour quite convinced her that\n",
      "Mrs. Elton was a vain woman, extremely well satisfied with herself, and\n",
      "thinking much of her own importance; that she meant to shine and be very\n",
      "superior, but with manners which had been formed in a bad school, pert\n",
      "and familiar; that all her notions were drawn from one set of people,\n",
      "and one style of living; that if not foolish she was ignorant, and that\n",
      "her society would certainly do Mr. Elton no good.\n",
      "\n",
      "Harriet would have been a better match. If not wise or refined herself,\n",
      "she would have connected him with those who were; but Miss Hawkins, it\n",
      "might be fairly supposed from her easy conceit, had been the best of\n",
      "her own set. The rich brother-in-law near Bristol was the pride of the\n",
      "alliance, and his place and his carriages were the pride of him.\n",
      "\n",
      "The very first subject after being seated was Maple Grove, “My brother\n",
      "Mr. Suckling's seat;”--a comparison of Hartfield to Maple Grove. The\n",
      "grounds of Hartfield were small, but neat and pretty; and the house was\n",
      "modern and well-built. Mrs. Elton seemed most favourably impressed\n",
      "by the size of the room, the entrance, and all that she could see or\n",
      "imagine. “Very like Maple Grove indeed!--She was quite struck by the\n",
      "likeness!--That room was the very shape and size of the morning-room\n",
      "at Maple Grove; her sister's favourite room.”--Mr. Elton was appealed\n",
      "to.--“Was not it astonishingly like?--She could really almost fancy\n",
      "herself at Maple Grove.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“And the staircase--You know, as I came in, I observed how very like the\n",
      "staircase was; placed exactly in the same part of the house. I really\n",
      "could not help exclaiming! I assure you, Miss Woodhouse, it is very\n",
      "delightful to me, to be reminded of a place I am so extremely partial to\n",
      "as Maple Grove. I have spent so many happy months there! (with a little\n",
      "sigh of sentiment). A charming place, undoubtedly. Every body who\n",
      "sees it is struck by its beauty; but to me, it has been quite a home.\n",
      "Whenever you are transplanted, like me, Miss Woodhouse, you will\n",
      "understand how very delightful it is to meet with any thing at all like\n",
      "what one has left behind. I always say this is quite one of the evils of\n",
      "matrimony.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Emma made as slight a reply as she could; but it was fully sufficient\n",
      "for Mrs. Elton, who only wanted to be talking herself.\n",
      "\n",
      "“So extremely like Maple Grove! And it is not merely the house--the\n",
      "grounds, I assure you, as far as I could observe, are strikingly like.\n",
      "The laurels at Maple Grove are in the same profusion as here, and stand\n",
      "very much in the same way--just across the lawn; and I had a glimpse\n",
      "of a fine large tree, with a bench round it, which put me so exactly in\n",
      "mind! My brother and sister will be enchanted with this place. People\n",
      "who have extensive grounds themselves are always pleased with any thing\n",
      "in the same style.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Emma doubted the truth of this sentiment. She had a great idea that\n",
      "people who had extensive grounds themselves cared very little for the\n",
      "extensive grounds of any body else; but it was not worth while to attack\n",
      "an error so double-dyed, and therefore only said in reply,\n",
      "\n",
      "“When you have seen more of this country, I am afraid you will think you\n",
      "have overrated Hartfield. Surry is full of beauties.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh! yes, I am quite aware of that. It is the garden of England, you\n",
      "know. Surry is the garden of England.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes; but we must not rest our claims on that distinction. Many\n",
      "counties, I believe, are called the garden of England, as well as\n",
      "Surry.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No, I fancy not,” replied Mrs. Elton, with a most satisfied smile.\n",
      "“I never heard any county but Surry called so.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Emma was silenced.\n",
      "\n",
      "“My brother and sister have promised us a visit in the spring, or summer\n",
      "at farthest,” continued Mrs. Elton; “and that will be our time for\n",
      "exploring. While they are with us, we shall explore a great deal, I dare\n",
      "say. They will have their barouche-landau, of course, which holds four\n",
      "perfectly; and therefore, without saying any thing of _our_ carriage,\n",
      "we should be able to explore the different beauties extremely well. They\n",
      "would hardly come in their chaise, I think, at that season of the\n",
      "year. Indeed, when the time draws on, I shall decidedly recommend their\n",
      "bringing the barouche-landau; it will be so very much preferable.\n",
      "When people come into a beautiful country of this sort, you know, Miss\n",
      "Woodhouse, one naturally wishes them to see as much as possible; and Mr.\n",
      "Suckling is extremely fond of exploring. We explored to King's-Weston\n",
      "twice last summer, in that way, most delightfully, just after their\n",
      "first having the barouche-landau. You have many parties of that kind\n",
      "here, I suppose, Miss Woodhouse, every summer?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No; not immediately here. We are rather out of distance of the very\n",
      "striking beauties which attract the sort of parties you speak of; and we\n",
      "are a very quiet set of people, I believe; more disposed to stay at home\n",
      "than engage in schemes of pleasure.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ah! there is nothing like staying at home for real comfort. Nobody can\n",
      "be more devoted to home than I am. I was quite a proverb for it at Maple\n",
      "Grove. Many a time has Selina said, when she has been going to Bristol,\n",
      "'I really cannot get this girl to move from the house. I absolutely must\n",
      "go in by myself, though I hate being stuck up in the barouche-landau\n",
      "without a companion; but Augusta, I believe, with her own good-will,\n",
      "would never stir beyond the park paling.' Many a time has she said so;\n",
      "and yet I am no advocate for entire seclusion. I think, on the contrary,\n",
      "when people shut themselves up entirely from society, it is a very\n",
      "bad thing; and that it is much more advisable to mix in the world in\n",
      "a proper degree, without living in it either too much or too little. I\n",
      "perfectly understand your situation, however, Miss Woodhouse--(looking\n",
      "towards Mr. Woodhouse), Your father's state of health must be a great\n",
      "drawback. Why does not he try Bath?--Indeed he should. Let me recommend\n",
      "Bath to you. I assure you I have no doubt of its doing Mr. Woodhouse\n",
      "good.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“My father tried it more than once, formerly; but without receiving any\n",
      "benefit; and Mr. Perry, whose name, I dare say, is not unknown to you,\n",
      "does not conceive it would be at all more likely to be useful now.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ah! that's a great pity; for I assure you, Miss Woodhouse, where the\n",
      "waters do agree, it is quite wonderful the relief they give. In my Bath\n",
      "life, I have seen such instances of it! And it is so cheerful a place,\n",
      "that it could not fail of being of use to Mr. Woodhouse's spirits,\n",
      "which, I understand, are sometimes much depressed. And as to its\n",
      "recommendations to _you_, I fancy I need not take much pains to dwell\n",
      "on them. The advantages of Bath to the young are pretty generally\n",
      "understood. It would be a charming introduction for you, who have lived\n",
      "so secluded a life; and I could immediately secure you some of the best\n",
      "society in the place. A line from me would bring you a little host of\n",
      "acquaintance; and my particular friend, Mrs. Partridge, the lady I have\n",
      "always resided with when in Bath, would be most happy to shew you any\n",
      "attentions, and would be the very person for you to go into public\n",
      "with.”\n",
      "\n",
      "It was as much as Emma could bear, without being impolite. The idea\n",
      "of her being indebted to Mrs. Elton for what was called an\n",
      "_introduction_--of her going into public under the auspices of a friend\n",
      "of Mrs. Elton's--probably some vulgar, dashing widow, who, with the\n",
      "help of a boarder, just made a shift to live!--The dignity of Miss\n",
      "Woodhouse, of Hartfield, was sunk indeed!\n",
      "\n",
      "She restrained herself, however, from any of the reproofs she could have\n",
      "given, and only thanked Mrs. Elton coolly; “but their going to Bath was\n",
      "quite out of the question; and she was not perfectly convinced that\n",
      "the place might suit her better than her father.” And then, to prevent\n",
      "farther outrage and indignation, changed the subject directly.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I do not ask whether you are musical, Mrs. Elton. Upon these occasions,\n",
      "a lady's character generally precedes her; and Highbury has long known\n",
      "that you are a superior performer.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh! no, indeed; I must protest against any such idea. A superior\n",
      "performer!--very far from it, I assure you. Consider from how partial\n",
      "a quarter your information came. I am doatingly fond of\n",
      "music--passionately fond;--and my friends say I am not entirely devoid\n",
      "of taste; but as to any thing else, upon my honour my performance is\n",
      "_mediocre_ to the last degree. You, Miss Woodhouse, I well know, play\n",
      "delightfully. I assure you it has been the greatest satisfaction,\n",
      "comfort, and delight to me, to hear what a musical society I am got\n",
      "into. I absolutely cannot do without music. It is a necessary of life to\n",
      "me; and having always been used to a very musical society, both at\n",
      "Maple Grove and in Bath, it would have been a most serious sacrifice. I\n",
      "honestly said as much to Mr. E. when he was speaking of my future\n",
      "home, and expressing his fears lest the retirement of it should be\n",
      "disagreeable; and the inferiority of the house too--knowing what I had\n",
      "been accustomed to--of course he was not wholly without apprehension.\n",
      "When he was speaking of it in that way, I honestly said that _the_\n",
      "_world_ I could give up--parties, balls, plays--for I had no fear of\n",
      "retirement. Blessed with so many resources within myself, the world was\n",
      "not necessary to _me_. I could do very well without it. To those who had\n",
      "no resources it was a different thing; but my resources made me quite\n",
      "independent. And as to smaller-sized rooms than I had been used to, I\n",
      "really could not give it a thought. I hoped I was perfectly equal to any\n",
      "sacrifice of that description. Certainly I had been accustomed to every\n",
      "luxury at Maple Grove; but I did assure him that two carriages were not\n",
      "necessary to my happiness, nor were spacious apartments. 'But,' said I,\n",
      "'to be quite honest, I do not think I can live without something of a\n",
      "musical society. I condition for nothing else; but without music, life\n",
      "would be a blank to me.'”\n",
      "\n",
      "“We cannot suppose,” said Emma, smiling, “that Mr. Elton would hesitate\n",
      "to assure you of there being a _very_ musical society in Highbury; and\n",
      "I hope you will not find he has outstepped the truth more than may be\n",
      "pardoned, in consideration of the motive.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No, indeed, I have no doubts at all on that head. I am delighted to\n",
      "find myself in such a circle. I hope we shall have many sweet little\n",
      "concerts together. I think, Miss Woodhouse, you and I must establish a\n",
      "musical club, and have regular weekly meetings at your house, or ours.\n",
      "Will not it be a good plan? If _we_ exert ourselves, I think we shall\n",
      "not be long in want of allies. Something of that nature would be\n",
      "particularly desirable for _me_, as an inducement to keep me in\n",
      "practice; for married women, you know--there is a sad story against\n",
      "them, in general. They are but too apt to give up music.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But you, who are so extremely fond of it--there can be no danger,\n",
      "surely?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I should hope not; but really when I look around among my acquaintance,\n",
      "I tremble. Selina has entirely given up music--never touches the\n",
      "instrument--though she played sweetly. And the same may be said of Mrs.\n",
      "Jeffereys--Clara Partridge, that was--and of the two Milmans, now Mrs.\n",
      "Bird and Mrs. James Cooper; and of more than I can enumerate. Upon my\n",
      "word it is enough to put one in a fright. I used to be quite angry with\n",
      "Selina; but really I begin now to comprehend that a married woman has\n",
      "many things to call her attention. I believe I was half an hour this\n",
      "morning shut up with my housekeeper.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But every thing of that kind,” said Emma, “will soon be in so regular a\n",
      "train--”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well,” said Mrs. Elton, laughing, “we shall see.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Emma, finding her so determined upon neglecting her music, had nothing\n",
      "more to say; and, after a moment's pause, Mrs. Elton chose another\n",
      "subject.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We have been calling at Randalls,” said she, “and found them both at\n",
      "home; and very pleasant people they seem to be. I like them extremely.\n",
      "Mr. Weston seems an excellent creature--quite a first-rate favourite\n",
      "with me already, I assure you. And _she_ appears so truly good--there is\n",
      "something so motherly and kind-hearted about her, that it wins upon one\n",
      "directly. She was your governess, I think?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Emma was almost too much astonished to answer; but Mrs. Elton hardly\n",
      "waited for the affirmative before she went on.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Having understood as much, I was rather astonished to find her so very\n",
      "lady-like! But she is really quite the gentlewoman.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Mrs. Weston's manners,” said Emma, “were always particularly good.\n",
      "Their propriety, simplicity, and elegance, would make them the safest\n",
      "model for any young woman.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“And who do you think came in while we were there?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Emma was quite at a loss. The tone implied some old acquaintance--and\n",
      "how could she possibly guess?\n",
      "\n",
      "“Knightley!” continued Mrs. Elton; “Knightley himself!--Was not it\n",
      "lucky?--for, not being within when he called the other day, I had never\n",
      "seen him before; and of course, as so particular a friend of Mr. E.'s,\n",
      "I had a great curiosity. 'My friend Knightley' had been so often\n",
      "mentioned, that I was really impatient to see him; and I must do my\n",
      "caro sposo the justice to say that he need not be ashamed of his friend.\n",
      "Knightley is quite the gentleman. I like him very much. Decidedly, I\n",
      "think, a very gentleman-like man.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Happily, it was now time to be gone. They were off; and Emma could\n",
      "breathe.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Insufferable woman!” was her immediate exclamation. “Worse than I had\n",
      "supposed. Absolutely insufferable! Knightley!--I could not have\n",
      "believed it. Knightley!--never seen him in her life before, and call\n",
      "him Knightley!--and discover that he is a gentleman! A little upstart,\n",
      "vulgar being, with her Mr. E., and her _caro_ _sposo_, and her\n",
      "resources, and all her airs of pert pretension and underbred finery.\n",
      "Actually to discover that Mr. Knightley is a gentleman! I doubt whether\n",
      "he will return the compliment, and discover her to be a lady. I could\n",
      "not have believed it! And to propose that she and I should unite to\n",
      "form a musical club! One would fancy we were bosom friends! And Mrs.\n",
      "Weston!--Astonished that the person who had brought me up should be a\n",
      "gentlewoman! Worse and worse. I never met with her equal. Much beyond\n",
      "my hopes. Harriet is disgraced by any comparison. Oh! what would Frank\n",
      "Churchill say to her, if he were here? How angry and how diverted he\n",
      "would be! Ah! there I am--thinking of him directly. Always the first\n",
      "person to be thought of! How I catch myself out! Frank Churchill comes\n",
      "as regularly into my mind!”--\n",
      "\n",
      "All this ran so glibly through her thoughts, that by the time her father\n",
      "had arranged himself, after the bustle of the Eltons' departure, and was\n",
      "ready to speak, she was very tolerably capable of attending.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, my dear,” he deliberately began, “considering we never saw her\n",
      "before, she seems a very pretty sort of young lady; and I dare say she\n",
      "was very much pleased with you. She speaks a little too quick. A little\n",
      "quickness of voice there is which rather hurts the ear. But I believe\n",
      "I am nice; I do not like strange voices; and nobody speaks like you and\n",
      "poor Miss Taylor. However, she seems a very obliging, pretty-behaved\n",
      "young lady, and no doubt will make him a very good wife. Though I think\n",
      "he had better not have married. I made the best excuses I could for not\n",
      "having been able to wait on him and Mrs. Elton on this happy occasion; I\n",
      "said that I hoped I _should_ in the course of the summer. But I ought to\n",
      "have gone before. Not to wait upon a bride is very remiss. Ah! it shews\n",
      "what a sad invalid I am! But I do not like the corner into Vicarage\n",
      "Lane.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I dare say your apologies were accepted, sir. Mr. Elton knows you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes: but a young lady--a bride--I ought to have paid my respects to her\n",
      "if possible. It was being very deficient.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But, my dear papa, you are no friend to matrimony; and therefore why\n",
      "should you be so anxious to pay your respects to a _bride_? It ought to\n",
      "be no recommendation to _you_. It is encouraging people to marry if you\n",
      "make so much of them.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No, my dear, I never encouraged any body to marry, but I would always\n",
      "wish to pay every proper attention to a lady--and a bride, especially,\n",
      "is never to be neglected. More is avowedly due to _her_. A bride, you\n",
      "know, my dear, is always the first in company, let the others be who\n",
      "they may.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, papa, if this is not encouragement to marry, I do not know what\n",
      "is. And I should never have expected you to be lending your sanction to\n",
      "such vanity-baits for poor young ladies.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“My dear, you do not understand me. This is a matter of mere\n",
      "common politeness and good-breeding, and has nothing to do with any\n",
      "encouragement to people to marry.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Emma had done. Her father was growing nervous, and could not understand\n",
      "_her_. Her mind returned to Mrs. Elton's offences, and long, very long,\n",
      "did they occupy her.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Emma was not required, by any subsequent discovery, to retract her ill\n",
      "opinion of Mrs. Elton. Her observation had been pretty correct. Such as\n",
      "Mrs. Elton appeared to her on this second interview, such she appeared\n",
      "whenever they met again,--self-important, presuming, familiar, ignorant,\n",
      "and ill-bred. She had a little beauty and a little accomplishment,\n",
      "but so little judgment that she thought herself coming with superior\n",
      "knowledge of the world, to enliven and improve a country neighbourhood;\n",
      "and conceived Miss Hawkins to have held such a place in society as Mrs.\n",
      "Elton's consequence only could surpass.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was no reason to suppose Mr. Elton thought at all differently from\n",
      "his wife. He seemed not merely happy with her, but proud. He had the air\n",
      "of congratulating himself on having brought such a woman to Highbury,\n",
      "as not even Miss Woodhouse could equal; and the greater part of her\n",
      "new acquaintance, disposed to commend, or not in the habit of judging,\n",
      "following the lead of Miss Bates's good-will, or taking it for granted\n",
      "that the bride must be as clever and as agreeable as she professed\n",
      "herself, were very well satisfied; so that Mrs. Elton's praise\n",
      "passed from one mouth to another as it ought to do, unimpeded by Miss\n",
      "Woodhouse, who readily continued her first contribution and talked with\n",
      "a good grace of her being “very pleasant and very elegantly dressed.”\n",
      "\n",
      "In one respect Mrs. Elton grew even worse than she had appeared at\n",
      "first. Her feelings altered towards Emma.--Offended, probably, by the\n",
      "little encouragement which her proposals of intimacy met with, she drew\n",
      "back in her turn and gradually became much more cold and distant; and\n",
      "though the effect was agreeable, the ill-will which produced it was\n",
      "necessarily increasing Emma's dislike. Her manners, too--and Mr.\n",
      "Elton's, were unpleasant towards Harriet. They were sneering and\n",
      "negligent. Emma hoped it must rapidly work Harriet's cure; but the\n",
      "sensations which could prompt such behaviour sunk them both very\n",
      "much.--It was not to be doubted that poor Harriet's attachment had been\n",
      "an offering to conjugal unreserve, and her own share in the story, under\n",
      "a colouring the least favourable to her and the most soothing to him,\n",
      "had in all likelihood been given also. She was, of course, the object\n",
      "of their joint dislike.--When they had nothing else to say, it must be\n",
      "always easy to begin abusing Miss Woodhouse; and the enmity which\n",
      "they dared not shew in open disrespect to her, found a broader vent in\n",
      "contemptuous treatment of Harriet.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Elton took a great fancy to Jane Fairfax; and from the first. Not\n",
      "merely when a state of warfare with one young lady might be supposed to\n",
      "recommend the other, but from the very first; and she was not satisfied\n",
      "with expressing a natural and reasonable admiration--but without\n",
      "solicitation, or plea, or privilege, she must be wanting to assist and\n",
      "befriend her.--Before Emma had forfeited her confidence, and about the\n",
      "third time of their meeting, she heard all Mrs. Elton's knight-errantry\n",
      "on the subject.--\n",
      "\n",
      "“Jane Fairfax is absolutely charming, Miss Woodhouse.--I quite rave\n",
      "about Jane Fairfax.--A sweet, interesting creature. So mild and\n",
      "ladylike--and with such talents!--I assure you I think she has very\n",
      "extraordinary talents. I do not scruple to say that she plays extremely\n",
      "well. I know enough of music to speak decidedly on that point. Oh! she\n",
      "is absolutely charming! You will laugh at my warmth--but, upon my word,\n",
      "I talk of nothing but Jane Fairfax.--And her situation is so calculated\n",
      "to affect one!--Miss Woodhouse, we must exert ourselves and endeavour\n",
      "to do something for her. We must bring her forward. Such talent as hers\n",
      "must not be suffered to remain unknown.--I dare say you have heard those\n",
      "charming lines of the poet,\n",
      "\n",
      "        'Full many a flower is born to blush unseen,\n",
      "          'And waste its fragrance on the desert air.'\n",
      "\n",
      "We must not allow them to be verified in sweet Jane Fairfax.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I cannot think there is any danger of it,” was Emma's calm answer--“and\n",
      "when you are better acquainted with Miss Fairfax's situation and\n",
      "understand what her home has been, with Colonel and Mrs. Campbell, I\n",
      "have no idea that you will suppose her talents can be unknown.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh! but dear Miss Woodhouse, she is now in such retirement, such\n",
      "obscurity, so thrown away.--Whatever advantages she may have enjoyed\n",
      "with the Campbells are so palpably at an end! And I think she feels it.\n",
      "I am sure she does. She is very timid and silent. One can see that she\n",
      "feels the want of encouragement. I like her the better for it. I\n",
      "must confess it is a recommendation to me. I am a great advocate for\n",
      "timidity--and I am sure one does not often meet with it.--But in those\n",
      "who are at all inferior, it is extremely prepossessing. Oh! I assure\n",
      "you, Jane Fairfax is a very delightful character, and interests me more\n",
      "than I can express.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You appear to feel a great deal--but I am not aware how you or any of\n",
      "Miss Fairfax's acquaintance here, any of those who have known her longer\n",
      "than yourself, can shew her any other attention than”--\n",
      "\n",
      "“My dear Miss Woodhouse, a vast deal may be done by those who dare to\n",
      "act. You and I need not be afraid. If _we_ set the example, many will\n",
      "follow it as far as they can; though all have not our situations. _We_\n",
      "have carriages to fetch and convey her home, and _we_ live in a style\n",
      "which could not make the addition of Jane Fairfax, at any time, the\n",
      "least inconvenient.--I should be extremely displeased if Wright were to\n",
      "send us up such a dinner, as could make me regret having asked _more_\n",
      "than Jane Fairfax to partake of it. I have no idea of that sort of\n",
      "thing. It is not likely that I _should_, considering what I have been\n",
      "used to. My greatest danger, perhaps, in housekeeping, may be quite the\n",
      "other way, in doing too much, and being too careless of expense. Maple\n",
      "Grove will probably be my model more than it ought to be--for we do not\n",
      "at all affect to equal my brother, Mr. Suckling, in income.--However, my\n",
      "resolution is taken as to noticing Jane Fairfax.--I shall certainly have\n",
      "her very often at my house, shall introduce her wherever I can, shall\n",
      "have musical parties to draw out her talents, and shall be constantly\n",
      "on the watch for an eligible situation. My acquaintance is so very\n",
      "extensive, that I have little doubt of hearing of something to suit\n",
      "her shortly.--I shall introduce her, of course, very particularly to my\n",
      "brother and sister when they come to us. I am sure they will like her\n",
      "extremely; and when she gets a little acquainted with them, her fears\n",
      "will completely wear off, for there really is nothing in the manners\n",
      "of either but what is highly conciliating.--I shall have her very often\n",
      "indeed while they are with me, and I dare say we shall sometimes find a\n",
      "seat for her in the barouche-landau in some of our exploring parties.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Poor Jane Fairfax!”--thought Emma.--“You have not deserved this. You\n",
      "may have done wrong with regard to Mr. Dixon, but this is a punishment\n",
      "beyond what you can have merited!--The kindness and protection of Mrs.\n",
      "Elton!--'Jane Fairfax and Jane Fairfax.' Heavens! Let me not suppose\n",
      "that she dares go about, Emma Woodhouse-ing me!--But upon my honour,\n",
      "there seems no limits to the licentiousness of that woman's tongue!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Emma had not to listen to such paradings again--to any so exclusively\n",
      "addressed to herself--so disgustingly decorated with a “dear Miss\n",
      "Woodhouse.” The change on Mrs. Elton's side soon afterwards appeared,\n",
      "and she was left in peace--neither forced to be the very particular\n",
      "friend of Mrs. Elton, nor, under Mrs. Elton's guidance, the very active\n",
      "patroness of Jane Fairfax, and only sharing with others in a general\n",
      "way, in knowing what was felt, what was meditated, what was done.\n",
      "\n",
      "She looked on with some amusement.--Miss Bates's gratitude for\n",
      "Mrs. Elton's attentions to Jane was in the first style of guileless\n",
      "simplicity and warmth. She was quite one of her worthies--the\n",
      "most amiable, affable, delightful woman--just as accomplished and\n",
      "condescending as Mrs. Elton meant to be considered. Emma's only surprize\n",
      "was that Jane Fairfax should accept those attentions and tolerate Mrs.\n",
      "Elton as she seemed to do. She heard of her walking with the Eltons,\n",
      "sitting with the Eltons, spending a day with the Eltons! This was\n",
      "astonishing!--She could not have believed it possible that the taste or\n",
      "the pride of Miss Fairfax could endure such society and friendship as\n",
      "the Vicarage had to offer.\n",
      "\n",
      "“She is a riddle, quite a riddle!” said she.--“To chuse to remain here\n",
      "month after month, under privations of every sort! And now to chuse the\n",
      "mortification of Mrs. Elton's notice and the penury of her conversation,\n",
      "rather than return to the superior companions who have always loved her\n",
      "with such real, generous affection.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Jane had come to Highbury professedly for three months; the Campbells\n",
      "were gone to Ireland for three months; but now the Campbells had\n",
      "promised their daughter to stay at least till Midsummer, and fresh\n",
      "invitations had arrived for her to join them there. According to Miss\n",
      "Bates--it all came from her--Mrs. Dixon had written most pressingly.\n",
      "Would Jane but go, means were to be found, servants sent, friends\n",
      "contrived--no travelling difficulty allowed to exist; but still she had\n",
      "declined it!\n",
      "\n",
      "“She must have some motive, more powerful than appears, for refusing\n",
      "this invitation,” was Emma's conclusion. “She must be under some sort\n",
      "of penance, inflicted either by the Campbells or herself. There is great\n",
      "fear, great caution, great resolution somewhere.--She is _not_ to be\n",
      "with the _Dixons_. The decree is issued by somebody. But why must she\n",
      "consent to be with the Eltons?--Here is quite a separate puzzle.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Upon her speaking her wonder aloud on that part of the subject, before\n",
      "the few who knew her opinion of Mrs. Elton, Mrs. Weston ventured this\n",
      "apology for Jane.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We cannot suppose that she has any great enjoyment at the Vicarage,\n",
      "my dear Emma--but it is better than being always at home. Her aunt is a\n",
      "good creature, but, as a constant companion, must be very tiresome. We\n",
      "must consider what Miss Fairfax quits, before we condemn her taste for\n",
      "what she goes to.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You are right, Mrs. Weston,” said Mr. Knightley warmly, “Miss Fairfax\n",
      "is as capable as any of us of forming a just opinion of Mrs. Elton.\n",
      "Could she have chosen with whom to associate, she would not have chosen\n",
      "her. But (with a reproachful smile at Emma) she receives attentions from\n",
      "Mrs. Elton, which nobody else pays her.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Emma felt that Mrs. Weston was giving her a momentary glance; and she\n",
      "was herself struck by his warmth. With a faint blush, she presently\n",
      "replied,\n",
      "\n",
      "“Such attentions as Mrs. Elton's, I should have imagined, would rather\n",
      "disgust than gratify Miss Fairfax. Mrs. Elton's invitations I should\n",
      "have imagined any thing but inviting.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I should not wonder,” said Mrs. Weston, “if Miss Fairfax were to have\n",
      "been drawn on beyond her own inclination, by her aunt's eagerness in\n",
      "accepting Mrs. Elton's civilities for her. Poor Miss Bates may\n",
      "very likely have committed her niece and hurried her into a greater\n",
      "appearance of intimacy than her own good sense would have dictated, in\n",
      "spite of the very natural wish of a little change.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Both felt rather anxious to hear him speak again; and after a few\n",
      "minutes silence, he said,\n",
      "\n",
      "“Another thing must be taken into consideration too--Mrs. Elton does\n",
      "not talk _to_ Miss Fairfax as she speaks _of_ her. We all know the\n",
      "difference between the pronouns he or she and thou, the plainest spoken\n",
      "amongst us; we all feel the influence of a something beyond common\n",
      "civility in our personal intercourse with each other--a something more\n",
      "early implanted. We cannot give any body the disagreeable hints that we\n",
      "may have been very full of the hour before. We feel things differently.\n",
      "And besides the operation of this, as a general principle, you may be\n",
      "sure that Miss Fairfax awes Mrs. Elton by her superiority both of mind\n",
      "and manner; and that, face to face, Mrs. Elton treats her with all the\n",
      "respect which she has a claim to. Such a woman as Jane Fairfax probably\n",
      "never fell in Mrs. Elton's way before--and no degree of vanity can\n",
      "prevent her acknowledging her own comparative littleness in action, if\n",
      "not in consciousness.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I know how highly you think of Jane Fairfax,” said Emma. Little Henry\n",
      "was in her thoughts, and a mixture of alarm and delicacy made her\n",
      "irresolute what else to say.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes,” he replied, “any body may know how highly I think of her.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“And yet,” said Emma, beginning hastily and with an arch look, but soon\n",
      "stopping--it was better, however, to know the worst at once--she hurried\n",
      "on--“And yet, perhaps, you may hardly be aware yourself how highly it\n",
      "is. The extent of your admiration may take you by surprize some day or\n",
      "other.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Knightley was hard at work upon the lower buttons of his thick\n",
      "leather gaiters, and either the exertion of getting them together, or\n",
      "some other cause, brought the colour into his face, as he answered,\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh! are you there?--But you are miserably behindhand. Mr. Cole gave me\n",
      "a hint of it six weeks ago.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He stopped.--Emma felt her foot pressed by Mrs. Weston, and did not\n",
      "herself know what to think. In a moment he went on--\n",
      "\n",
      "“That will never be, however, I can assure you. Miss Fairfax, I dare\n",
      "say, would not have me if I were to ask her--and I am very sure I shall\n",
      "never ask her.”\n",
      "\n",

      "in and sit with us in this comfortable way, if you were married.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Knightley was thoughtful again. The result of his reverie was, “No,\n",
      "Emma, I do not think the extent of my admiration for her will ever take\n",
      "me by surprize.--I never had a thought of her in that way, I assure\n",
      "you.” And soon afterwards, “Jane Fairfax is a very charming young\n",
      "woman--but not even Jane Fairfax is perfect. She has a fault. She has\n",
      "not the open temper which a man would wish for in a wife.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Emma could not but rejoice to hear that she had a fault. “Well,” said\n",
      "she, “and you soon silenced Mr. Cole, I suppose?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, very soon. He gave me a quiet hint; I told him he was mistaken;\n",
      "he asked my pardon and said no more. Cole does not want to be wiser or\n",
      "wittier than his neighbours.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“In that respect how unlike dear Mrs. Elton, who wants to be wiser and\n",
      "wittier than all the world! I wonder how she speaks of the Coles--what\n",
      "she calls them! How can she find any appellation for them, deep enough\n",
      "in familiar vulgarity? She calls you, Knightley--what can she do for\n",
      "Mr. Cole? And so I am not to be surprized that Jane Fairfax accepts\n",
      "her civilities and consents to be with her. Mrs. Weston, your argument\n",
      "weighs most with me. I can much more readily enter into the temptation\n",
      "of getting away from Miss Bates, than I can believe in the triumph of\n",
      "Miss Fairfax's mind over Mrs. Elton. I have no faith in Mrs. Elton's\n",
      "acknowledging herself the inferior in thought, word, or deed; or in her\n",
      "being under any restraint beyond her own scanty rule of good-breeding.\n",
      "I cannot imagine that she will not be continually insulting her visitor\n",
      "with praise, encouragement, and offers of service; that she will not be\n",
      "continually detailing her magnificent intentions, from the procuring her\n",
      "a permanent situation to the including her in those delightful exploring\n",
      "parties which are to take place in the barouche-landau.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Jane Fairfax has feeling,” said Mr. Knightley--“I do not accuse her\n",
      "of want of feeling. Her sensibilities, I suspect, are strong--and her\n",
      "temper excellent in its power of forbearance, patience, self-control;\n",
      "but it wants openness. She is reserved, more reserved, I think, than\n",
      "she used to be--And I love an open temper. No--till Cole alluded to my\n",
      "supposed attachment, it had never entered my head. I saw Jane Fairfax\n",
      "and conversed with her, with admiration and pleasure always--but with no\n",
      "thought beyond.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, Mrs. Weston,” said Emma triumphantly when he left them, “what do\n",
      "you say now to Mr. Knightley's marrying Jane Fairfax?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why, really, dear Emma, I say that he is so very much occupied by the\n",

      "CHAPTER XVI\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Every body in and about Highbury who had ever visited Mr. Elton, was\n",
      "disposed to pay him attention on his marriage. Dinner-parties and\n",
      "evening-parties were made for him and his lady; and invitations flowed\n",
      "in so fast that she had soon the pleasure of apprehending they were\n",
      "never to have a disengaged day.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I see how it is,” said she. “I see what a life I am to lead among you.\n",
      "Upon my word we shall be absolutely dissipated. We really seem quite\n",
      "the fashion. If this is living in the country, it is nothing very\n",
      "formidable. From Monday next to Saturday, I assure you we have not a\n",
      "disengaged day!--A woman with fewer resources than I have, need not have\n",
      "been at a loss.”\n",
      "\n",
      "No invitation came amiss to her. Her Bath habits made evening-parties\n",
      "perfectly natural to her, and Maple Grove had given her a taste for\n",
      "dinners. She was a little shocked at the want of two drawing rooms, at\n",
      "the poor attempt at rout-cakes, and there being no ice in the Highbury\n",
      "card-parties. Mrs. Bates, Mrs. Perry, Mrs. Goddard and others, were a\n",
      "good deal behind-hand in knowledge of the world, but she would soon shew\n",
      "them how every thing ought to be arranged. In the course of the spring\n",
      "she must return their civilities by one very superior party--in which\n",
      "her card-tables should be set out with their separate candles and\n",
      "unbroken packs in the true style--and more waiters engaged for the\n",
      "evening than their own establishment could furnish, to carry round the\n",
      "refreshments at exactly the proper hour, and in the proper order.\n",
      "\n",
      "Emma, in the meanwhile, could not be satisfied without a dinner at\n",
      "Hartfield for the Eltons. They must not do less than others, or she\n",
      "should be exposed to odious suspicions, and imagined capable of pitiful\n",
      "resentment. A dinner there must be. After Emma had talked about it for\n",
      "ten minutes, Mr. Woodhouse felt no unwillingness, and only made the\n",
      "usual stipulation of not sitting at the bottom of the table himself,\n",
      "with the usual regular difficulty of deciding who should do it for him.\n",
      "\n",
      "The persons to be invited, required little thought. Besides the\n",
      "Eltons, it must be the Westons and Mr. Knightley; so far it was all of\n",
      "course--and it was hardly less inevitable that poor little Harriet must\n",
      "be asked to make the eighth:--but this invitation was not given with\n",
      "equal satisfaction, and on many accounts Emma was particularly pleased\n",
      "by Harriet's begging to be allowed to decline it. “She would rather not\n",
      "be in his company more than she could help. She was not yet quite\n",
      "able to see him and his charming happy wife together, without feeling\n",
      "uncomfortable. If Miss Woodhouse would not be displeased, she would\n",
      "rather stay at home.” It was precisely what Emma would have wished, had\n",
      "she deemed it possible enough for wishing. She was delighted with the\n",
      "fortitude of her little friend--for fortitude she knew it was in her to\n",
      "give up being in company and stay at home; and she could now invite the\n",
      "very person whom she really wanted to make the eighth, Jane Fairfax.--\n",
      "Since her last conversation with Mrs. Weston and Mr. Knightley, she\n",
      "was more conscience-stricken about Jane Fairfax than she had often\n",
      "been.--Mr. Knightley's words dwelt with her. He had said that Jane\n",
      "Fairfax received attentions from Mrs. Elton which nobody else paid her.\n",
      "\n",
      "“This is very true,” said she, “at least as far as relates to me, which\n",
      "was all that was meant--and it is very shameful.--Of the same age--and\n",
      "always knowing her--I ought to have been more her friend.--She will\n",
      "never like me now. I have neglected her too long. But I will shew her\n",
      "greater attention than I have done.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Every invitation was successful. They were all disengaged and all\n",
      "happy.--The preparatory interest of this dinner, however, was not yet\n",
      "over. A circumstance rather unlucky occurred. The two eldest little\n",
      "Knightleys were engaged to pay their grandpapa and aunt a visit of some\n",
      "weeks in the spring, and their papa now proposed bringing them, and\n",
      "staying one whole day at Hartfield--which one day would be the very day\n",
      "of this party.--His professional engagements did not allow of his being\n",
      "put off, but both father and daughter were disturbed by its happening\n",
      "so. Mr. Woodhouse considered eight persons at dinner together as the\n",
      "utmost that his nerves could bear--and here would be a ninth--and Emma\n",
      "apprehended that it would be a ninth very much out of humour at not\n",
      "being able to come even to Hartfield for forty-eight hours without\n",
      "falling in with a dinner-party.\n",
      "\n",
      "She comforted her father better than she could comfort herself, by\n",
      "representing that though he certainly would make them nine, yet\n",
      "he always said so little, that the increase of noise would be very\n",
      "immaterial. She thought it in reality a sad exchange for herself, to\n",
      "have him with his grave looks and reluctant conversation opposed to her\n",
      "instead of his brother.\n",
      "\n",
      "The event was more favourable to Mr. Woodhouse than to Emma. John\n",
      "Knightley came; but Mr. Weston was unexpectedly summoned to town and\n",
      "must be absent on the very day. He might be able to join them in the\n",
      "evening, but certainly not to dinner. Mr. Woodhouse was quite at ease;\n",
      "and the seeing him so, with the arrival of the little boys and the\n",
      "philosophic composure of her brother on hearing his fate, removed the\n",
      "chief of even Emma's vexation.\n",
      "\n",
      "The day came, the party were punctually assembled, and Mr. John\n",
      "Knightley seemed early to devote himself to the business of being\n",
      "agreeable. Instead of drawing his brother off to a window while they\n",
      "waited for dinner, he was talking to Miss Fairfax. Mrs. Elton,\n",
      "as elegant as lace and pearls could make her, he looked at in\n",
      "silence--wanting only to observe enough for Isabella's information--but\n",
      "Miss Fairfax was an old acquaintance and a quiet girl, and he could talk\n",
      "to her. He had met her before breakfast as he was returning from a walk\n",
      "with his little boys, when it had been just beginning to rain. It was\n",
      "natural to have some civil hopes on the subject, and he said,\n",
      "\n",
      "“I hope you did not venture far, Miss Fairfax, this morning, or I am\n",
      "sure you must have been wet.--We scarcely got home in time. I hope you\n",
      "turned directly.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I went only to the post-office,” said she, “and reached home before the\n",
      "rain was much. It is my daily errand. I always fetch the letters when\n",
      "I am here. It saves trouble, and is a something to get me out. A walk\n",
      "before breakfast does me good.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Not a walk in the rain, I should imagine.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No, but it did not absolutely rain when I set out.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. John Knightley smiled, and replied,\n",
      "\n",
      "“That is to say, you chose to have your walk, for you were not six yards\n",
      "from your own door when I had the pleasure of meeting you; and Henry\n",
      "and John had seen more drops than they could count long before. The\n",
      "post-office has a great charm at one period of our lives. When you have\n",
      "lived to my age, you will begin to think letters are never worth going\n",
      "through the rain for.”\n",
      "\n",
      "There was a little blush, and then this answer,\n",
      "\n",
      "“I must not hope to be ever situated as you are, in the midst of every\n",
      "dearest connexion, and therefore I cannot expect that simply growing\n",
      "older should make me indifferent about letters.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Indifferent! Oh! no--I never conceived you could become indifferent.\n",
      "Letters are no matter of indifference; they are generally a very\n",
      "positive curse.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You are speaking of letters of business; mine are letters of\n",
      "friendship.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I have often thought them the worst of the two,” replied he coolly.\n",
      "“Business, you know, may bring money, but friendship hardly ever does.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ah! you are not serious now. I know Mr. John Knightley too well--I am\n",
      "very sure he understands the value of friendship as well as any body. I\n",
      "can easily believe that letters are very little to you, much less than\n",
      "to me, but it is not your being ten years older than myself which\n",
      "makes the difference, it is not age, but situation. You have every\n",
      "body dearest to you always at hand, I, probably, never shall again;\n",
      "and therefore till I have outlived all my affections, a post-office,\n",
      "I think, must always have power to draw me out, in worse weather than\n",
      "to-day.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“When I talked of your being altered by time, by the progress of years,”\n",
      " said John Knightley, “I meant to imply the change of situation which\n",
      "time usually brings. I consider one as including the other. Time will\n",
      "generally lessen the interest of every attachment not within the daily\n",
      "circle--but that is not the change I had in view for you. As an old\n",
      "friend, you will allow me to hope, Miss Fairfax, that ten years hence\n",
      "you may have as many concentrated objects as I have.”\n",
      "\n",
      "It was kindly said, and very far from giving offence. A pleasant “thank\n",
      "you” seemed meant to laugh it off, but a blush, a quivering lip, a tear\n",
      "in the eye, shewed that it was felt beyond a laugh. Her attention was\n",
      "now claimed by Mr. Woodhouse, who being, according to his custom on such\n",
      "occasions, making the circle of his guests, and paying his particular\n",
      "compliments to the ladies, was ending with her--and with all his mildest\n",
      "urbanity, said,\n",
      "\n",
      "“I am very sorry to hear, Miss Fairfax, of your being out this morning\n",
      "in the rain. Young ladies should take care of themselves.--Young ladies\n",
      "are delicate plants. They should take care of their health and their\n",
      "complexion. My dear, did you change your stockings?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, sir, I did indeed; and I am very much obliged by your kind\n",
      "solicitude about me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“My dear Miss Fairfax, young ladies are very sure to be cared for.--I\n",
      "hope your good grand-mama and aunt are well. They are some of my very\n",
      "old friends. I wish my health allowed me to be a better neighbour. You\n",
      "do us a great deal of honour to-day, I am sure. My daughter and I\n",
      "are both highly sensible of your goodness, and have the greatest\n",
      "satisfaction in seeing you at Hartfield.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The kind-hearted, polite old man might then sit down and feel that he\n",
      "had done his duty, and made every fair lady welcome and easy.\n",
      "\n",
      "By this time, the walk in the rain had reached Mrs. Elton, and her\n",
      "remonstrances now opened upon Jane.\n",
      "\n",
      "“My dear Jane, what is this I hear?--Going to the post-office in the\n",
      "rain!--This must not be, I assure you.--You sad girl, how could you do\n",
      "such a thing?--It is a sign I was not there to take care of you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Jane very patiently assured her that she had not caught any cold.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh! do not tell _me_. You really are a very sad girl, and do not know\n",
      "how to take care of yourself.--To the post-office indeed! Mrs. Weston,\n",
      "did you ever hear the like? You and I must positively exert our\n",
      "authority.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“My advice,” said Mrs. Weston kindly and persuasively, “I certainly do\n",
      "feel tempted to give. Miss Fairfax, you must not run such risks.--Liable\n",
      "as you have been to severe colds, indeed you ought to be particularly\n",
      "careful, especially at this time of year. The spring I always think\n",
      "requires more than common care. Better wait an hour or two, or even\n",
      "half a day for your letters, than run the risk of bringing on your cough\n",
      "again. Now do not you feel that you had? Yes, I am sure you are much too\n",
      "reasonable. You look as if you would not do such a thing again.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh! she _shall_ _not_ do such a thing again,” eagerly rejoined Mrs.\n",
      "Elton. “We will not allow her to do such a thing again:”--and nodding\n",
      "significantly--“there must be some arrangement made, there must indeed.\n",
      "I shall speak to Mr. E. The man who fetches our letters every morning\n",
      "(one of our men, I forget his name) shall inquire for yours too and\n",
      "bring them to you. That will obviate all difficulties you know; and from\n",
      "_us_ I really think, my dear Jane, you can have no scruple to accept\n",
      "such an accommodation.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You are extremely kind,” said Jane; “but I cannot give up my early\n",
      "walk. I am advised to be out of doors as much as I can, I must walk\n",
      "somewhere, and the post-office is an object; and upon my word, I have\n",
      "scarcely ever had a bad morning before.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“My dear Jane, say no more about it. The thing is determined, that is\n",
      "(laughing affectedly) as far as I can presume to determine any thing\n",
      "without the concurrence of my lord and master. You know, Mrs. Weston,\n",
      "you and I must be cautious how we express ourselves. But I do flatter\n",
      "myself, my dear Jane, that my influence is not entirely worn out. If I\n",
      "meet with no insuperable difficulties therefore, consider that point as\n",
      "settled.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Excuse me,” said Jane earnestly, “I cannot by any means consent to such\n",
      "an arrangement, so needlessly troublesome to your servant. If the errand\n",
      "were not a pleasure to me, it could be done, as it always is when I am\n",
      "not here, by my grandmama's.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh! my dear; but so much as Patty has to do!--And it is a kindness to\n",
      "employ our men.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Jane looked as if she did not mean to be conquered; but instead of\n",
      "answering, she began speaking again to Mr. John Knightley.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The post-office is a wonderful establishment!” said she.--“The\n",
      "regularity and despatch of it! If one thinks of all that it has to do,\n",
      "and all that it does so well, it is really astonishing!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It is certainly very well regulated.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“So seldom that any negligence or blunder appears! So seldom that\n",
      "a letter, among the thousands that are constantly passing about the\n",
      "kingdom, is even carried wrong--and not one in a million, I suppose,\n",
      "actually lost! And when one considers the variety of hands, and of bad\n",
      "hands too, that are to be deciphered, it increases the wonder.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“The clerks grow expert from habit.--They must begin with some quickness\n",
      "of sight and hand, and exercise improves them. If you want any farther\n",
      "explanation,” continued he, smiling, “they are paid for it. That is\n",
      "the key to a great deal of capacity. The public pays and must be served\n",
      "well.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The varieties of handwriting were farther talked of, and the usual\n",
      "observations made.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I have heard it asserted,” said John Knightley, “that the same sort\n",
      "of handwriting often prevails in a family; and where the same master\n",
      "teaches, it is natural enough. But for that reason, I should imagine\n",
      "the likeness must be chiefly confined to the females, for boys have very\n",
      "little teaching after an early age, and scramble into any hand they can\n",
      "get. Isabella and Emma, I think, do write very much alike. I have not\n",
      "always known their writing apart.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes,” said his brother hesitatingly, “there is a likeness. I know what\n",
      "you mean--but Emma's hand is the strongest.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Isabella and Emma both write beautifully,” said Mr. Woodhouse; “and\n",
      "always did. And so does poor Mrs. Weston”--with half a sigh and half a\n",
      "smile at her.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I never saw any gentleman's handwriting”--Emma began, looking also at\n",
      "Mrs. Weston; but stopped, on perceiving that Mrs. Weston was attending\n",
      "to some one else--and the pause gave her time to reflect, “Now, how am\n",
      "I going to introduce him?--Am I unequal to speaking his name at once\n",
      "before all these people? Is it necessary for me to use any roundabout\n",
      "phrase?--Your Yorkshire friend--your correspondent in Yorkshire;--that\n",
      "would be the way, I suppose, if I were very bad.--No, I can pronounce\n",
      "his name without the smallest distress. I certainly get better and\n",
      "better.--Now for it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Weston was disengaged and Emma began again--“Mr. Frank Churchill\n",
      "writes one of the best gentleman's hands I ever saw.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I do not admire it,” said Mr. Knightley. “It is too small--wants\n",
      "strength. It is like a woman's writing.”\n",
      "\n",
      "This was not submitted to by either lady. They vindicated him against\n",
      "the base aspersion. “No, it by no means wanted strength--it was not a\n",
      "large hand, but very clear and certainly strong. Had not Mrs. Weston any\n",
      "letter about her to produce?” No, she had heard from him very lately,\n",
      "but having answered the letter, had put it away.\n",
      "\n",
      "“If we were in the other room,” said Emma, “if I had my writing-desk, I\n",
      "am sure I could produce a specimen. I have a note of his.--Do not you\n",
      "remember, Mrs. Weston, employing him to write for you one day?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“He chose to say he was employed”--\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, well, I have that note; and can shew it after dinner to convince\n",
      "Mr. Knightley.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh! when a gallant young man, like Mr. Frank Churchill,” said Mr.\n",

      "now, because it is expected of me. A bride, you know, must appear like\n",
      "a bride, but my natural taste is all for simplicity; a simple style\n",
      "of dress is so infinitely preferable to finery. But I am quite in the\n",

      "Woodhouse was almost as glad to see him now, as he would have been sorry\n",
      "to see him before. John Knightley only was in mute astonishment.--That\n",
      "a man who might have spent his evening quietly at home after a day\n",
      "of business in London, should set off again, and walk half a mile\n",
      "to another man's house, for the sake of being in mixed company till\n",
      "bed-time, of finishing his day in the efforts of civility and the noise\n",
      "of numbers, was a circumstance to strike him deeply. A man who had been\n",
      "in motion since eight o'clock in the morning, and might now have been\n",
      "still, who had been long talking, and might have been silent, who had\n",
      "been in more than one crowd, and might have been alone!--Such a man, to\n",
      "quit the tranquillity and independence of his own fireside, and on the\n",
      "evening of a cold sleety April day rush out again into the world!--Could\n",
      "he by a touch of his finger have instantly taken back his wife, there\n",
      "would have been a motive; but his coming would probably prolong rather\n",
      "than break up the party. John Knightley looked at him with amazement,\n",

      "communication, which, though principally addressed to Mrs. Weston, he\n",
      "had not the smallest doubt of being highly interesting to every body in\n",

      "and words had nothing to restrain them. She was happy, she knew she was\n",
      "happy, and knew she ought to be happy. Her congratulations were warm and\n",
      "open; but Emma could not speak so fluently. _She_ was a little occupied\n",
      "in weighing her own feelings, and trying to understand the degree of her\n",

      "\n",
      "Mr. Weston, however, too eager to be very observant, too communicative\n",

      "It was well that he took every body's joy for granted, or he might\n",
      "not have thought either Mr. Woodhouse or Mr. Knightley particularly\n",
      "delighted. They were the first entitled, after Mrs. Weston and Emma, to\n",
      "be made happy;--from them he would have proceeded to Miss Fairfax, but\n",
      "she was so deep in conversation with John Knightley, that it would have\n",

      "This was too loud a call for a compliment to be passed by, and Mr.\n",
      "Weston, with a very good grace, immediately exclaimed,\n",
      "\n",
      "“My dear madam! Nobody but yourself could imagine such a thing possible.\n",
      "Not heard of you!--I believe Mrs. Weston's letters lately have been full\n",
      "of very little else than Mrs. Elton.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He had done his duty and could return to his son.\n",
      "\n",
      "“When Frank left us,” continued he, “it was quite uncertain when we\n",
      "might see him again, which makes this day's news doubly welcome. It has\n",
      "been completely unexpected. That is, _I_ always had a strong persuasion\n",
      "he would be here again soon, I was sure something favourable would turn\n",
      "up--but nobody believed me. He and Mrs. Weston were both dreadfully\n",
      "desponding. 'How could he contrive to come? And how could it be supposed\n",
      "that his uncle and aunt would spare him again?' and so forth--I always\n",
      "felt that something would happen in our favour; and so it has, you see.\n",
      "I have observed, Mrs. Elton, in the course of my life, that if things\n",
      "are going untowardly one month, they are sure to mend the next.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Very true, Mr. Weston, perfectly true. It is just what I used to say to\n",
      "a certain gentleman in company in the days of courtship, when, because\n",
      "things did not go quite right, did not proceed with all the rapidity\n",
      "which suited his feelings, he was apt to be in despair, and exclaim that\n",
      "he was sure at this rate it would be _May_ before Hymen's saffron robe\n",
      "would be put on for us. Oh! the pains I have been at to dispel those\n",
      "gloomy ideas and give him cheerfuller views! The carriage--we had\n",
      "disappointments about the carriage;--one morning, I remember, he came to\n",
      "me quite in despair.”\n",
      "\n",
      "She was stopped by a slight fit of coughing, and Mr. Weston instantly\n",
      "seized the opportunity of going on.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You were mentioning May. May is the very month which Mrs. Churchill\n",
      "is ordered, or has ordered herself, to spend in some warmer place than\n",
      "Enscombe--in short, to spend in London; so that we have the agreeable\n",
      "prospect of frequent visits from Frank the whole spring--precisely the\n",
      "season of the year which one should have chosen for it: days almost at\n",
      "the longest; weather genial and pleasant, always inviting one out, and\n",
      "never too hot for exercise. When he was here before, we made the best\n",
      "of it; but there was a good deal of wet, damp, cheerless weather;\n",
      "there always is in February, you know, and we could not do half that we\n",
      "intended. Now will be the time. This will be complete enjoyment; and I\n",
      "do not know, Mrs. Elton, whether the uncertainty of our meetings, the\n",
      "sort of constant expectation there will be of his coming in to-day or\n",
      "to-morrow, and at any hour, may not be more friendly to happiness than\n",
      "having him actually in the house. I think it is so. I think it is the\n",
      "state of mind which gives most spirit and delight. I hope you will be\n",
      "pleased with my son; but you must not expect a prodigy. He is generally\n",
      "thought a fine young man, but do not expect a prodigy. Mrs. Weston's\n",
      "partiality for him is very great, and, as you may suppose, most\n",
      "gratifying to me. She thinks nobody equal to him.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“And I assure you, Mr. Weston, I have very little doubt that my opinion\n",
      "will be decidedly in his favour. I have heard so much in praise of Mr.\n",
      "Frank Churchill.--At the same time it is fair to observe, that I am one\n",
      "of those who always judge for themselves, and are by no means implicitly\n",
      "guided by others. I give you notice that as I find your son, so I shall\n",
      "judge of him.--I am no flatterer.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Weston was musing.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I hope,” said he presently, “I have not been severe upon poor Mrs.\n",
      "Churchill. If she is ill I should be sorry to do her injustice; but\n",
      "there are some traits in her character which make it difficult for me to\n",
      "speak of her with the forbearance I could wish. You cannot be ignorant,\n",
      "Mrs. Elton, of my connexion with the family, nor of the treatment I have\n",
      "met with; and, between ourselves, the whole blame of it is to be laid\n",
      "to her. She was the instigator. Frank's mother would never have been\n",
      "slighted as she was but for her. Mr. Churchill has pride; but his pride\n",
      "is nothing to his wife's: his is a quiet, indolent, gentlemanlike sort\n",
      "of pride that would harm nobody, and only make himself a little helpless\n",
      "and tiresome; but her pride is arrogance and insolence! And what\n",
      "inclines one less to bear, she has no fair pretence of family or blood.\n",
      "She was nobody when he married her, barely the daughter of a gentleman;\n",
      "but ever since her being turned into a Churchill she has out-Churchill'd\n",
      "them all in high and mighty claims: but in herself, I assure you, she is\n",
      "an upstart.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Only think! well, that must be infinitely provoking! I have quite\n",
      "a horror of upstarts. Maple Grove has given me a thorough disgust to\n",
      "people of that sort; for there is a family in that neighbourhood who\n",
      "are such an annoyance to my brother and sister from the airs they give\n",
      "themselves! Your description of Mrs. Churchill made me think of them\n",
      "directly. People of the name of Tupman, very lately settled there, and\n",
      "encumbered with many low connexions, but giving themselves immense airs,\n",
      "and expecting to be on a footing with the old established families.\n",
      "A year and a half is the very utmost that they can have lived at West\n",
      "Hall; and how they got their fortune nobody knows. They came from\n",
      "Birmingham, which is not a place to promise much, you know, Mr. Weston.\n",
      "One has not great hopes from Birmingham. I always say there is something\n",
      "direful in the sound: but nothing more is positively known of the\n",
      "Tupmans, though a good many things I assure you are suspected; and\n",
      "yet by their manners they evidently think themselves equal even to\n",
      "my brother, Mr. Suckling, who happens to be one of their nearest\n",
      "neighbours. It is infinitely too bad. Mr. Suckling, who has been eleven\n",
      "years a resident at Maple Grove, and whose father had it before him--I\n",
      "believe, at least--I am almost sure that old Mr. Suckling had completed\n",
      "the purchase before his death.”\n",
      "\n",
      "They were interrupted. Tea was carrying round, and Mr. Weston, having\n",
      "said all that he wanted, soon took the opportunity of walking away.\n",
      "\n",
      "After tea, Mr. and Mrs. Weston, and Mr. Elton sat down with Mr.\n",
      "Woodhouse to cards. The remaining five were left to their own powers,\n",
      "and Emma doubted their getting on very well; for Mr. Knightley seemed\n",
      "little disposed for conversation; Mrs. Elton was wanting notice, which\n",
      "nobody had inclination to pay, and she was herself in a worry of spirits\n",
      "which would have made her prefer being silent.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. John Knightley proved more talkative than his brother. He was to\n",
      "leave them early the next day; and he soon began with--\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, Emma, I do not believe I have any thing more to say about the\n",
      "boys; but you have your sister's letter, and every thing is down at full\n",
      "length there we may be sure. My charge would be much more concise than\n",
      "her's, and probably not much in the same spirit; all that I have to\n",
      "recommend being comprised in, do not spoil them, and do not physic\n",
      "them.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I rather hope to satisfy you both,” said Emma, “for I shall do all\n",
      "in my power to make them happy, which will be enough for Isabella; and\n",
      "happiness must preclude false indulgence and physic.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“And if you find them troublesome, you must send them home again.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“That is very likely. You think so, do not you?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I hope I am aware that they may be too noisy for your father--or even\n",
      "may be some encumbrance to you, if your visiting engagements continue to\n",
      "increase as much as they have done lately.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Increase!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Certainly; you must be sensible that the last half-year has made a\n",
      "great difference in your way of life.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Difference! No indeed I am not.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“There can be no doubt of your being much more engaged with company than\n",
      "you used to be. Witness this very time. Here am I come down for only\n",
      "one day, and you are engaged with a dinner-party!--When did it happen\n",
      "before, or any thing like it? Your neighbourhood is increasing, and you\n",
      "mix more with it. A little while ago, every letter to Isabella brought\n",
      "an account of fresh gaieties; dinners at Mr. Cole's, or balls at the\n",
      "Crown. The difference which Randalls, Randalls alone makes in your\n",
      "goings-on, is very great.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes,” said his brother quickly, “it is Randalls that does it all.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Very well--and as Randalls, I suppose, is not likely to have less\n",
      "influence than heretofore, it strikes me as a possible thing, Emma, that\n",
      "Henry and John may be sometimes in the way. And if they are, I only beg\n",
      "you to send them home.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No,” cried Mr. Knightley, “that need not be the consequence. Let them\n",
      "be sent to Donwell. I shall certainly be at leisure.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Upon my word,” exclaimed Emma, “you amuse me! I should like to know how\n",
      "many of all my numerous engagements take place without your being of\n",
      "the party; and why I am to be supposed in danger of wanting leisure to\n",
      "attend to the little boys. These amazing engagements of mine--what have\n",
      "they been? Dining once with the Coles--and having a ball talked of,\n",
      "which never took place. I can understand you--(nodding at Mr. John\n",
      "Knightley)--your good fortune in meeting with so many of your friends at\n",
      "once here, delights you too much to pass unnoticed. But you, (turning to\n",
      "Mr. Knightley,) who know how very, very seldom I am ever two hours from\n",
      "Hartfield, why you should foresee such a series of dissipation for me, I\n",
      "cannot imagine. And as to my dear little boys, I must say, that if Aunt\n",
      "Emma has not time for them, I do not think they would fare much better\n",
      "with Uncle Knightley, who is absent from home about five hours where she\n",

      "or settling his accounts.”\n",

      "A very little quiet reflection was enough to satisfy Emma as to the\n",
      "nature of her agitation on hearing this news of Frank Churchill. She\n",
      "was soon convinced that it was not for herself she was feeling at all\n",
      "apprehensive or embarrassed; it was for him. Her own attachment had\n",
      "really subsided into a mere nothing; it was not worth thinking of;--but\n",
      "if he, who had undoubtedly been always so much the most in love of the\n",
      "two, were to be returning with the same warmth of sentiment which he had\n",
      "taken away, it would be very distressing. If a separation of two\n",
      "months should not have cooled him, there were dangers and evils before\n",
      "her:--caution for him and for herself would be necessary. She did\n",
      "not mean to have her own affections entangled again, and it would be\n",
      "incumbent on her to avoid any encouragement of his.\n",
      "\n",
      "She wished she might be able to keep him from an absolute declaration.\n",
      "That would be so very painful a conclusion of their present\n",
      "acquaintance! and yet, she could not help rather anticipating something\n",
      "decisive. She felt as if the spring would not pass without bringing a\n",
      "crisis, an event, a something to alter her present composed and tranquil\n",
      "state.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was not very long, though rather longer than Mr. Weston had foreseen,\n",
      "before she had the power of forming some opinion of Frank Churchill's\n",
      "feelings. The Enscombe family were not in town quite so soon as had been\n",
      "imagined, but he was at Highbury very soon afterwards. He rode down\n",
      "for a couple of hours; he could not yet do more; but as he came from\n",
      "Randalls immediately to Hartfield, she could then exercise all her quick\n",
      "observation, and speedily determine how he was influenced, and how she\n",
      "must act. They met with the utmost friendliness. There could be no doubt\n",
      "of his great pleasure in seeing her. But she had an almost instant doubt\n",
      "of his caring for her as he had done, of his feeling the same tenderness\n",
      "in the same degree. She watched him well. It was a clear thing he was\n",
      "less in love than he had been. Absence, with the conviction probably\n",
      "of her indifference, had produced this very natural and very desirable\n",
      "effect.\n",
      "\n",
      "He was in high spirits; as ready to talk and laugh as ever, and seemed\n",
      "delighted to speak of his former visit, and recur to old stories: and he\n",
      "was not without agitation. It was not in his calmness that she read\n",
      "his comparative difference. He was not calm; his spirits were evidently\n",
      "fluttered; there was restlessness about him. Lively as he was, it seemed\n",
      "a liveliness that did not satisfy himself; but what decided her belief\n",
      "on the subject, was his staying only a quarter of an hour, and hurrying\n",
      "away to make other calls in Highbury. “He had seen a group of old\n",
      "acquaintance in the street as he passed--he had not stopped, he would\n",
      "not stop for more than a word--but he had the vanity to think they would\n",
      "be disappointed if he did not call, and much as he wished to stay longer\n",
      "at Hartfield, he must hurry off.” She had no doubt as to his being less\n",
      "in love--but neither his agitated spirits, nor his hurrying away, seemed\n",
      "like a perfect cure; and she was rather inclined to think it implied a\n",
      "dread of her returning power, and a discreet resolution of not trusting\n",
      "himself with her long.\n",
      "\n",
      "This was the only visit from Frank Churchill in the course of ten days.\n",
      "He was often hoping, intending to come--but was always prevented. His\n",
      "aunt could not bear to have him leave her. Such was his own account at\n",
      "Randall's. If he were quite sincere, if he really tried to come, it was\n",
      "to be inferred that Mrs. Churchill's removal to London had been of no\n",
      "service to the wilful or nervous part of her disorder. That she was\n",
      "really ill was very certain; he had declared himself convinced of it, at\n",
      "Randalls. Though much might be fancy, he could not doubt, when he looked\n",
      "back, that she was in a weaker state of health than she had been half a\n",
      "year ago. He did not believe it to proceed from any thing that care\n",
      "and medicine might not remove, or at least that she might not have many\n",
      "years of existence before her; but he could not be prevailed on, by all\n",
      "his father's doubts, to say that her complaints were merely imaginary,\n",
      "or that she was as strong as ever.\n",
      "\n",
      "It soon appeared that London was not the place for her. She could\n",
      "not endure its noise. Her nerves were under continual irritation and\n",
      "suffering; and by the ten days' end, her nephew's letter to Randalls\n",
      "communicated a change of plan. They were going to remove immediately to\n",
      "Richmond. Mrs. Churchill had been recommended to the medical skill of\n",
      "an eminent person there, and had otherwise a fancy for the place. A\n",
      "ready-furnished house in a favourite spot was engaged, and much benefit\n",
      "expected from the change.\n",
      "\n",
      "Emma heard that Frank wrote in the highest spirits of this arrangement,\n",
      "and seemed most fully to appreciate the blessing of having two months\n",
      "before him of such near neighbourhood to many dear friends--for the\n",
      "house was taken for May and June. She was told that now he wrote with\n",
      "the greatest confidence of being often with them, almost as often as he\n",
      "could even wish.\n",
      "\n",
      "Emma saw how Mr. Weston understood these joyous prospects. He was\n",
      "considering her as the source of all the happiness they offered. She\n",
      "hoped it was not so. Two months must bring it to the proof.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Weston's own happiness was indisputable. He was quite delighted.\n",
      "It was the very circumstance he could have wished for. Now, it would be\n",
      "really having Frank in their neighbourhood. What were nine miles to\n",
      "a young man?--An hour's ride. He would be always coming over. The\n",
      "difference in that respect of Richmond and London was enough to make\n",
      "the whole difference of seeing him always and seeing him never. Sixteen\n",
      "miles--nay, eighteen--it must be full eighteen to Manchester-street--was\n",
      "a serious obstacle. Were he ever able to get away, the day would be\n",
      "spent in coming and returning. There was no comfort in having him in\n",
      "London; he might as well be at Enscombe; but Richmond was the very\n",
      "distance for easy intercourse. Better than nearer!\n",
      "\n",
      "One good thing was immediately brought to a certainty by this\n",
      "removal,--the ball at the Crown. It had not been forgotten before,\n",
      "but it had been soon acknowledged vain to attempt to fix a day. Now,\n",
      "however, it was absolutely to be; every preparation was resumed, and\n",
      "very soon after the Churchills had removed to Richmond, a few lines from\n",
      "Frank, to say that his aunt felt already much better for the change, and\n",
      "that he had no doubt of being able to join them for twenty-four hours at\n",
      "any given time, induced them to name as early a day as possible.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Weston's ball was to be a real thing. A very few to-morrows stood\n",
      "between the young people of Highbury and happiness.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Woodhouse was resigned. The time of year lightened the evil to him.\n",
      "May was better for every thing than February. Mrs. Bates was engaged to\n",
      "spend the evening at Hartfield, James had due notice, and he sanguinely\n",
      "hoped that neither dear little Henry nor dear little John would have any\n",

      "\n",
      "No second meeting had there yet been between him and Emma. The room\n",
      "at the Crown was to witness it;--but it would be better than a\n",
      "common meeting in a crowd. Mr. Weston had been so very earnest in his\n",
      "entreaties for her arriving there as soon as possible after themselves,\n",
      "for the purpose of taking her opinion as to the propriety and comfort of\n",
      "the rooms before any other persons came, that she could not refuse him,\n",
      "and must therefore spend some quiet interval in the young man's company.\n",

      "Frank Churchill seemed to have been on the watch; and though he did not\n",
      "say much, his eyes declared that he meant to have a delightful evening.\n",
      "They all walked about together, to see that every thing was as it should\n",
      "be; and within a few minutes were joined by the contents of another\n",
      "carriage, which Emma could not hear the sound of at first, without great\n",
      "surprize. “So unreasonably early!” she was going to exclaim; but she\n",
      "presently found that it was a family of old friends, who were coming,\n",
      "like herself, by particular desire, to help Mr. Weston's judgment; and\n",
      "they were so very closely followed by another carriage of cousins,\n",
      "who had been entreated to come early with the same distinguishing\n",
      "earnestness, on the same errand, that it seemed as if half the company\n",
      "might soon be collected together for the purpose of preparatory\n",
      "inspection.\n",

      "Emma perceived that her taste was not the only taste on which Mr. Weston\n",
      "depended, and felt, that to be the favourite and intimate of a man\n",
      "who had so many intimates and confidantes, was not the very first\n",
      "distinction in the scale of vanity. She liked his open manners, but\n",
      "a little less of open-heartedness would have made him a higher\n",
      "character.--General benevolence, but not general friendship, made a\n",
      "man what he ought to be.--She could fancy such a man. The whole party\n",
      "walked about, and looked, and praised again; and then, having nothing\n",
      "else to do, formed a sort of half-circle round the fire, to observe\n",
      "in their various modes, till other subjects were started, that, though\n",

      "Emma found that it was not Mr. Weston's fault that the number of privy\n",
      "councillors was not yet larger. They had stopped at Mrs. Bates's door\n",
      "to offer the use of their carriage, but the aunt and niece were to be\n",
      "brought by the Eltons.\n",
      "\n",
      "Frank was standing by her, but not steadily; there was a restlessness,\n",
      "which shewed a mind not at ease. He was looking about, he was going to\n",
      "the door, he was watching for the sound of other carriages,--impatient\n",
      "to begin, or afraid of being always near her.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Elton was spoken of. “I think she must be here soon,” said he. “I\n",
      "have a great curiosity to see Mrs. Elton, I have heard so much of her.\n",
      "It cannot be long, I think, before she comes.”\n",
      "\n",
      "A carriage was heard. He was on the move immediately; but coming back,\n",
      "said,\n",
      "\n",
      "“I am forgetting that I am not acquainted with her. I have never seen\n",
      "either Mr. or Mrs. Elton. I have no business to put myself forward.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. and Mrs. Elton appeared; and all the smiles and the proprieties\n",
      "passed.\n",
      "\n",
      "“But Miss Bates and Miss Fairfax!” said Mr. Weston, looking about. “We\n",
      "thought you were to bring them.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The mistake had been slight. The carriage was sent for them now. Emma\n",
      "longed to know what Frank's first opinion of Mrs. Elton might be; how\n",
      "he was affected by the studied elegance of her dress, and her smiles of\n",
      "graciousness. He was immediately qualifying himself to form an opinion,\n",
      "by giving her very proper attention, after the introduction had passed.\n",
      "\n",
      "In a few minutes the carriage returned.--Somebody talked of rain.--“I\n",
      "will see that there are umbrellas, sir,” said Frank to his father:\n",
      "“Miss Bates must not be forgotten:” and away he went. Mr. Weston was\n",
      "following; but Mrs. Elton detained him, to gratify him by her opinion\n",
      "of his son; and so briskly did she begin, that the young man himself,\n",
      "though by no means moving slowly, could hardly be out of hearing.\n",
      "\n",
      "“A very fine young man indeed, Mr. Weston. You know I candidly told you\n",
      "I should form my own opinion; and I am happy to say that I am extremely\n",
      "pleased with him.--You may believe me. I never compliment. I think him\n",
      "a very handsome young man, and his manners are precisely what I like and\n",
      "approve--so truly the gentleman, without the least conceit or puppyism.\n",
      "You must know I have a vast dislike to puppies--quite a horror of them.\n",
      "They were never tolerated at Maple Grove. Neither Mr. Suckling nor\n",
      "me had ever any patience with them; and we used sometimes to say very\n",
      "cutting things! Selina, who is mild almost to a fault, bore with them\n",
      "much better.”\n",
      "\n",
      "While she talked of his son, Mr. Weston's attention was chained; but\n",
      "when she got to Maple Grove, he could recollect that there were ladies\n",
      "just arriving to be attended to, and with happy smiles must hurry away.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Elton turned to Mrs. Weston. “I have no doubt of its being our\n",
      "carriage with Miss Bates and Jane. Our coachman and horses are so\n",
      "extremely expeditious!--I believe we drive faster than any body.--What\n",
      "a pleasure it is to send one's carriage for a friend!--I understand you\n",
      "were so kind as to offer, but another time it will be quite unnecessary.\n",
      "You may be very sure I shall always take care of _them_.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Miss Bates and Miss Fairfax, escorted by the two gentlemen, walked into\n",
      "the room; and Mrs. Elton seemed to think it as much her duty as Mrs.\n",
      "Weston's to receive them. Her gestures and movements might be understood\n",
      "by any one who looked on like Emma; but her words, every body's words,\n",
      "were soon lost under the incessant flow of Miss Bates, who came in\n",
      "talking, and had not finished her speech under many minutes after her\n",
      "being admitted into the circle at the fire. As the door opened she was\n",
      "heard,\n",
      "\n",
      "“So very obliging of you!--No rain at all. Nothing to signify. I do not\n",
      "care for myself. Quite thick shoes. And Jane declares--Well!--(as soon\n",
      "as she was within the door) Well! This is brilliant indeed!--This is\n",
      "admirable!--Excellently contrived, upon my word. Nothing wanting. Could\n",
      "not have imagined it.--So well lighted up!--Jane, Jane, look!--did you\n",
      "ever see any thing? Oh! Mr. Weston, you must really have had Aladdin's\n",
      "lamp. Good Mrs. Stokes would not know her own room again. I saw her as\n",
      "I came in; she was standing in the entrance. 'Oh! Mrs. Stokes,' said\n",
      "I--but I had not time for more.” She was now met by Mrs. Weston.--“Very\n",
      "well, I thank you, ma'am. I hope you are quite well. Very happy to hear\n",
      "it. So afraid you might have a headache!--seeing you pass by so often,\n",
      "and knowing how much trouble you must have. Delighted to hear it indeed.\n",
      "Ah! dear Mrs. Elton, so obliged to you for the carriage!--excellent\n",
      "time. Jane and I quite ready. Did not keep the horses a moment. Most\n",
      "comfortable carriage.--Oh! and I am sure our thanks are due to you,\n",
      "Mrs. Weston, on that score. Mrs. Elton had most kindly sent Jane a note,\n",
      "or we should have been.--But two such offers in one day!--Never were\n",
      "such neighbours. I said to my mother, 'Upon my word, ma'am--.' Thank\n",
      "you, my mother is remarkably well. Gone to Mr. Woodhouse's. I made her\n",
      "take her shawl--for the evenings are not warm--her large new shawl--\n",
      "Mrs. Dixon's wedding-present.--So kind of her to think of my mother!\n",
      "Bought at Weymouth, you know--Mr. Dixon's choice. There were three\n",
      "others, Jane says, which they hesitated about some time. Colonel\n",
      "Campbell rather preferred an olive. My dear Jane, are you sure you did\n",
      "not wet your feet?--It was but a drop or two, but I am so afraid:--but\n",
      "Mr. Frank Churchill was so extremely--and there was a mat to step\n",
      "upon--I shall never forget his extreme politeness.--Oh! Mr. Frank\n",
      "Churchill, I must tell you my mother's spectacles have never been in\n",
      "fault since; the rivet never came out again. My mother often talks of\n",
      "your good-nature. Does not she, Jane?--Do not we often talk of Mr. Frank\n",
      "Churchill?--Ah! here's Miss Woodhouse.--Dear Miss Woodhouse, how do\n",
      "you do?--Very well I thank you, quite well. This is meeting quite\n",
      "in fairy-land!--Such a transformation!--Must not compliment, I know\n",
      "(eyeing Emma most complacently)--that would be rude--but upon my word,\n",
      "Miss Woodhouse, you do look--how do you like Jane's hair?--You are\n",
      "a judge.--She did it all herself. Quite wonderful how she does her\n",
      "hair!--No hairdresser from London I think could.--Ah! Dr. Hughes I\n",
      "declare--and Mrs. Hughes. Must go and speak to Dr. and Mrs. Hughes for a\n",
      "moment.--How do you do? How do you do?--Very well, I thank you. This\n",
      "is delightful, is not it?--Where's dear Mr. Richard?--Oh! there he is.\n",
      "Don't disturb him. Much better employed talking to the young ladies. How\n",
      "do you do, Mr. Richard?--I saw you the other day as you rode through\n",
      "the town--Mrs. Otway, I protest!--and good Mr. Otway, and Miss Otway\n",
      "and Miss Caroline.--Such a host of friends!--and Mr. George and Mr.\n",
      "Arthur!--How do you do? How do you all do?--Quite well, I am much\n",
      "obliged to you. Never better.--Don't I hear another carriage?--Who can\n",
      "this be?--very likely the worthy Coles.--Upon my word, this is charming\n",
      "to be standing about among such friends! And such a noble fire!--I am\n",
      "quite roasted. No coffee, I thank you, for me--never take coffee.--A\n",
      "little tea if you please, sir, by and bye,--no hurry--Oh! here it comes.\n",
      "Every thing so good!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Frank Churchill returned to his station by Emma; and as soon as Miss\n",
      "Bates was quiet, she found herself necessarily overhearing the discourse\n",
      "of Mrs. Elton and Miss Fairfax, who were standing a little way behind\n",
      "her.--He was thoughtful. Whether he were overhearing too, she could not\n",
      "determine. After a good many compliments to Jane on her dress and look,\n",
      "compliments very quietly and properly taken, Mrs. Elton was evidently\n",
      "wanting to be complimented herself--and it was, “How do you like\n",
      "my gown?--How do you like my trimming?--How has Wright done my\n",
      "hair?”--with many other relative questions, all answered with patient\n",
      "politeness. Mrs. Elton then said, “Nobody can think less of dress in\n",
      "general than I do--but upon such an occasion as this, when every body's\n",
      "eyes are so much upon me, and in compliment to the Westons--who I have\n",
      "no doubt are giving this ball chiefly to do me honour--I would not wish\n",
      "to be inferior to others. And I see very few pearls in the room except\n",
      "mine.--So Frank Churchill is a capital dancer, I understand.--We shall\n",
      "see if our styles suit.--A fine young man certainly is Frank Churchill.\n",
      "I like him very well.”\n",
      "\n",
      "At this moment Frank began talking so vigorously, that Emma could not\n",
      "but imagine he had overheard his own praises, and did not want to hear\n",
      "more;--and the voices of the ladies were drowned for a while, till\n",
      "another suspension brought Mrs. Elton's tones again distinctly\n",
      "forward.--Mr. Elton had just joined them, and his wife was exclaiming,\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh! you have found us out at last, have you, in our seclusion?--I was\n",
      "this moment telling Jane, I thought you would begin to be impatient for\n",
      "tidings of us.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Jane!”--repeated Frank Churchill, with a look of surprize and\n",
      "displeasure.--“That is easy--but Miss Fairfax does not disapprove it, I\n",
      "suppose.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“How do you like Mrs. Elton?” said Emma in a whisper.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Not at all.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You are ungrateful.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ungrateful!--What do you mean?” Then changing from a frown to a\n",
      "smile--“No, do not tell me--I do not want to know what you mean.--Where\n",
      "is my father?--When are we to begin dancing?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Emma could hardly understand him; he seemed in an odd humour. He walked\n",
      "off to find his father, but was quickly back again with both Mr. and\n",
      "Mrs. Weston. He had met with them in a little perplexity, which must be\n",
      "laid before Emma. It had just occurred to Mrs. Weston that Mrs. Elton\n",
      "must be asked to begin the ball; that she would expect it; which\n",
      "interfered with all their wishes of giving Emma that distinction.--Emma\n",
      "heard the sad truth with fortitude.\n",
      "\n",
      "“And what are we to do for a proper partner for her?” said Mr. Weston.\n",
      "“She will think Frank ought to ask her.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Frank turned instantly to Emma, to claim her former promise; and\n",
      "boasted himself an engaged man, which his father looked his most perfect\n",
      "approbation of--and it then appeared that Mrs. Weston was wanting _him_\n",
      "to dance with Mrs. Elton himself, and that their business was to help to\n",
      "persuade him into it, which was done pretty soon.--Mr. Weston and Mrs.\n",
      "Elton led the way, Mr. Frank Churchill and Miss Woodhouse followed.\n",
      "Emma must submit to stand second to Mrs. Elton, though she had always\n",
      "considered the ball as peculiarly for her. It was almost enough to make\n",
      "her think of marrying. Mrs. Elton had undoubtedly the advantage, at this\n",
      "time, in vanity completely gratified; for though she had intended to\n",
      "begin with Frank Churchill, she could not lose by the change. Mr. Weston\n",
      "might be his son's superior.--In spite of this little rub, however,\n",
      "Emma was smiling with enjoyment, delighted to see the respectable length\n",
      "of the set as it was forming, and to feel that she had so many hours\n",
      "of unusual festivity before her.--She was more disturbed by Mr.\n",
      "Knightley's not dancing than by any thing else.--There he was, among\n",
      "the standers-by, where he ought not to be; he ought to be dancing,--not\n",
      "classing himself with the husbands, and fathers, and whist-players, who\n",
      "were pretending to feel an interest in the dance till their rubbers were\n",
      "made up,--so young as he looked!--He could not have appeared to greater\n",
      "advantage perhaps anywhere, than where he had placed himself. His tall,\n",
      "firm, upright figure, among the bulky forms and stooping shoulders of\n",
      "the elderly men, was such as Emma felt must draw every body's eyes;\n",
      "and, excepting her own partner, there was not one among the whole row of\n",
      "young men who could be compared with him.--He moved a few steps nearer,\n",
      "and those few steps were enough to prove in how gentlemanlike a manner,\n",
      "with what natural grace, he must have danced, would he but take the\n",
      "trouble.--Whenever she caught his eye, she forced him to smile; but\n",
      "in general he was looking grave. She wished he could love a ballroom\n",
      "better, and could like Frank Churchill better.--He seemed often\n",
      "observing her. She must not flatter herself that he thought of her\n",
      "dancing, but if he were criticising her behaviour, she did not feel\n",
      "afraid. There was nothing like flirtation between her and her partner.\n",
      "They seemed more like cheerful, easy friends, than lovers. That Frank\n",
      "Churchill thought less of her than he had done, was indubitable.\n",
      "\n",
      "The ball proceeded pleasantly. The anxious cares, the incessant\n",
      "attentions of Mrs. Weston, were not thrown away. Every body seemed\n",
      "happy; and the praise of being a delightful ball, which is seldom\n",
      "bestowed till after a ball has ceased to be, was repeatedly given in\n",
      "the very beginning of the existence of this. Of very important, very\n",
      "recordable events, it was not more productive than such meetings usually\n",
      "are. There was one, however, which Emma thought something of.--The two\n",
      "last dances before supper were begun, and Harriet had no partner;--the\n",
      "only young lady sitting down;--and so equal had been hitherto the\n",
      "number of dancers, that how there could be any one disengaged was the\n",
      "wonder!--But Emma's wonder lessened soon afterwards, on seeing Mr. Elton\n",
      "sauntering about. He would not ask Harriet to dance if it were possible\n",
      "to be avoided: she was sure he would not--and she was expecting him\n",
      "every moment to escape into the card-room.\n",
      "\n",
      "Escape, however, was not his plan. He came to the part of the room where\n",
      "the sitters-by were collected, spoke to some, and walked about in front\n",
      "of them, as if to shew his liberty, and his resolution of maintaining\n",
      "it. He did not omit being sometimes directly before Miss Smith, or\n",
      "speaking to those who were close to her.--Emma saw it. She was not yet\n",
      "dancing; she was working her way up from the bottom, and had therefore\n",
      "leisure to look around, and by only turning her head a little she saw\n",
      "it all. When she was half-way up the set, the whole group were exactly\n",
      "behind her, and she would no longer allow her eyes to watch; but Mr.\n",
      "Elton was so near, that she heard every syllable of a dialogue which\n",
      "just then took place between him and Mrs. Weston; and she perceived that\n",
      "his wife, who was standing immediately above her, was not only\n",
      "listening also, but even encouraging him by significant glances.--The\n",
      "kind-hearted, gentle Mrs. Weston had left her seat to join him and say,\n",
      "“Do not you dance, Mr. Elton?” to which his prompt reply was, “Most\n",
      "readily, Mrs. Weston, if you will dance with me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Me!--oh! no--I would get you a better partner than myself. I am no\n",
      "dancer.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“If Mrs. Gilbert wishes to dance,” said he, “I shall have great\n",
      "pleasure, I am sure--for, though beginning to feel myself rather an old\n",
      "married man, and that my dancing days are over, it would give me very\n",
      "great pleasure at any time to stand up with an old friend like Mrs.\n",
      "Gilbert.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Mrs. Gilbert does not mean to dance, but there is a young lady\n",
      "disengaged whom I should be very glad to see dancing--Miss Smith.” “Miss\n",
      "Smith!--oh!--I had not observed.--You are extremely obliging--and if I\n",
      "were not an old married man.--But my dancing days are over, Mrs. Weston.\n",
      "You will excuse me. Any thing else I should be most happy to do, at your\n",
      "command--but my dancing days are over.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Weston said no more; and Emma could imagine with what surprize and\n",
      "mortification she must be returning to her seat. This was Mr. Elton! the\n",
      "amiable, obliging, gentle Mr. Elton.--She looked round for a moment; he\n",
      "had joined Mr. Knightley at a little distance, and was arranging himself\n",
      "for settled conversation, while smiles of high glee passed between him\n",
      "and his wife.\n",
      "\n",
      "She would not look again. Her heart was in a glow, and she feared her\n",
      "face might be as hot.\n",
      "\n",
      "In another moment a happier sight caught her;--Mr. Knightley leading\n",
      "Harriet to the set!--Never had she been more surprized, seldom more\n",
      "delighted, than at that instant. She was all pleasure and gratitude,\n",
      "both for Harriet and herself, and longed to be thanking him; and though\n",
      "too distant for speech, her countenance said much, as soon as she could\n",
      "catch his eye again.\n",
      "\n",
      "His dancing proved to be just what she had believed it, extremely good;\n",
      "and Harriet would have seemed almost too lucky, if it had not been for\n",
      "the cruel state of things before, and for the very complete enjoyment\n",
      "and very high sense of the distinction which her happy features\n",
      "announced. It was not thrown away on her, she bounded higher than ever,\n",
      "flew farther down the middle, and was in a continual course of smiles.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Elton had retreated into the card-room, looking (Emma trusted) very\n",
      "foolish. She did not think he was quite so hardened as his wife, though\n",
      "growing very like her;--_she_ spoke some of her feelings, by observing\n",
      "audibly to her partner,\n",
      "\n",
      "“Knightley has taken pity on poor little Miss Smith!--Very good-natured,\n",
      "I declare.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Supper was announced. The move began; and Miss Bates might be heard from\n",
      "that moment, without interruption, till her being seated at table and\n",
      "taking up her spoon.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Jane, Jane, my dear Jane, where are you?--Here is your tippet. Mrs.\n",
      "Weston begs you to put on your tippet. She says she is afraid there will\n",
      "be draughts in the passage, though every thing has been done--One door\n",
      "nailed up--Quantities of matting--My dear Jane, indeed you must.\n",
      "Mr. Churchill, oh! you are too obliging! How well you put it on!--so\n",
      "gratified! Excellent dancing indeed!--Yes, my dear, I ran home, as I\n",
      "said I should, to help grandmama to bed, and got back again, and\n",
      "nobody missed me.--I set off without saying a word, just as I told you.\n",
      "Grandmama was quite well, had a charming evening with Mr. Woodhouse, a\n",
      "vast deal of chat, and backgammon.--Tea was made downstairs, biscuits\n",
      "and baked apples and wine before she came away: amazing luck in some\n",
      "of her throws: and she inquired a great deal about you, how you were\n",
      "amused, and who were your partners. 'Oh!' said I, 'I shall not forestall\n",
      "Jane; I left her dancing with Mr. George Otway; she will love to tell\n",
      "you all about it herself to-morrow: her first partner was Mr. Elton,\n",
      "I do not know who will ask her next, perhaps Mr. William Cox.' My dear\n",
      "sir, you are too obliging.--Is there nobody you would not rather?--I am\n",
      "not helpless. Sir, you are most kind. Upon my word, Jane on one arm, and\n",
      "me on the other!--Stop, stop, let us stand a little back, Mrs. Elton is\n",
      "going; dear Mrs. Elton, how elegant she looks!--Beautiful lace!--Now we\n",
      "all follow in her train. Quite the queen of the evening!--Well, here we\n",
      "are at the passage. Two steps, Jane, take care of the two steps. Oh! no,\n",
      "there is but one. Well, I was persuaded there were two. How very odd!\n",
      "I was convinced there were two, and there is but one. I never saw any\n",
      "thing equal to the comfort and style--Candles everywhere.--I was telling\n",
      "you of your grandmama, Jane,--There was a little disappointment.--The\n",
      "baked apples and biscuits, excellent in their way, you know; but there\n",
      "was a delicate fricassee of sweetbread and some asparagus brought in at\n",
      "first, and good Mr. Woodhouse, not thinking the asparagus quite boiled\n",
      "enough, sent it all out again. Now there is nothing grandmama loves\n",
      "better than sweetbread and asparagus--so she was rather disappointed,\n",
      "but we agreed we would not speak of it to any body, for fear of\n",
      "its getting round to dear Miss Woodhouse, who would be so very much\n",
      "concerned!--Well, this is brilliant! I am all amazement! could not have\n",
      "supposed any thing!--Such elegance and profusion!--I have seen nothing\n",
      "like it since--Well, where shall we sit? where shall we sit? Anywhere,\n",
      "so that Jane is not in a draught. Where _I_ sit is of no consequence.\n",
      "Oh! do you recommend this side?--Well, I am sure, Mr. Churchill--only\n",
      "it seems too good--but just as you please. What you direct in this house\n",
      "cannot be wrong. Dear Jane, how shall we ever recollect half the dishes\n",
      "for grandmama? Soup too! Bless me! I should not be helped so soon, but\n",
      "it smells most excellent, and I cannot help beginning.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Emma had no opportunity of speaking to Mr. Knightley till after supper;\n",
      "but, when they were all in the ballroom again, her eyes invited\n",

      "This little explanation with Mr. Knightley gave Emma considerable\n",
      "pleasure. It was one of the agreeable recollections of the ball, which\n",
      "she walked about the lawn the next morning to enjoy.--She was extremely\n",
      "glad that they had come to so good an understanding respecting the\n",
      "Eltons, and that their opinions of both husband and wife were so much\n",
      "alike; and his praise of Harriet, his concession in her favour, was\n",
      "peculiarly gratifying. The impertinence of the Eltons, which for a few\n",
      "minutes had threatened to ruin the rest of her evening, had been the\n",
      "occasion of some of its highest satisfactions; and she looked forward\n",
      "to another happy result--the cure of Harriet's infatuation.--From\n",
      "Harriet's manner of speaking of the circumstance before they quitted the\n",
      "ballroom, she had strong hopes. It seemed as if her eyes were suddenly\n",
      "opened, and she were enabled to see that Mr. Elton was not the superior\n",
      "creature she had believed him. The fever was over, and Emma could\n",
      "harbour little fear of the pulse being quickened again by injurious\n",
      "courtesy. She depended on the evil feelings of the Eltons for\n",
      "supplying all the discipline of pointed neglect that could be farther\n",
      "requisite.--Harriet rational, Frank Churchill not too much in love, and\n",
      "Mr. Knightley not wanting to quarrel with her, how very happy a summer\n",
      "must be before her!\n",
      "\n",
      "She was not to see Frank Churchill this morning. He had told her that he\n",
      "could not allow himself the pleasure of stopping at Hartfield, as he was\n",
      "to be at home by the middle of the day. She did not regret it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Having arranged all these matters, looked them through, and put them all\n",
      "to rights, she was just turning to the house with spirits freshened up\n",
      "for the demands of the two little boys, as well as of their grandpapa,\n",
      "when the great iron sweep-gate opened, and two persons entered whom she\n",
      "had never less expected to see together--Frank Churchill, with Harriet\n",
      "leaning on his arm--actually Harriet!--A moment sufficed to convince\n",
      "her that something extraordinary had happened. Harriet looked white\n",
      "and frightened, and he was trying to cheer her.--The iron gates and the\n",
      "front-door were not twenty yards asunder;--they were all three soon in\n",

      "\n",
      "A young lady who faints, must be recovered; questions must be answered,\n",

      "Miss Smith, and Miss Bickerton, another parlour boarder at Mrs.\n",
      "Goddard's, who had been also at the ball, had walked out together, and\n",
      "taken a road, the Richmond road, which, though apparently public enough\n",
      "for safety, had led them into alarm.--About half a mile beyond Highbury,\n",
      "making a sudden turn, and deeply shaded by elms on each side, it became\n",
      "for a considerable stretch very retired; and when the young ladies\n",
      "had advanced some way into it, they had suddenly perceived at a small\n",
      "distance before them, on a broader patch of greensward by the side, a\n",
      "party of gipsies. A child on the watch, came towards them to beg; and\n",
      "Miss Bickerton, excessively frightened, gave a great scream, and calling\n",
      "on Harriet to follow her, ran up a steep bank, cleared a slight hedge at\n",
      "the top, and made the best of her way by a short cut back to Highbury.\n",
      "But poor Harriet could not follow. She had suffered very much from cramp\n",
      "after dancing, and her first attempt to mount the bank brought on such\n",
      "a return of it as made her absolutely powerless--and in this state, and\n",

      "How the trampers might have behaved, had the young ladies been more\n",
      "courageous, must be doubtful; but such an invitation for attack could\n",

      "headed by a stout woman and a great boy, all clamorous, and impertinent\n",
      "in look, though not absolutely in word.--More and more frightened, she\n",
      "immediately promised them money, and taking out her purse, gave them a\n",
      "shilling, and begged them not to want more, or to use her ill.--She\n",
      "was then able to walk, though but slowly, and was moving away--but her\n",
      "terror and her purse were too tempting, and she was followed, or rather\n",
      "surrounded, by the whole gang, demanding more.\n",
      "\n",
      "In this state Frank Churchill had found her, she trembling and\n",
      "conditioning, they loud and insolent. By a most fortunate chance his\n",
      "leaving Highbury had been delayed so as to bring him to her assistance\n",
      "at this critical moment. The pleasantness of the morning had induced\n",
      "him to walk forward, and leave his horses to meet him by another road,\n",
      "a mile or two beyond Highbury--and happening to have borrowed a pair\n",
      "of scissors the night before of Miss Bates, and to have forgotten to\n",
      "restore them, he had been obliged to stop at her door, and go in for a\n",
      "few minutes: he was therefore later than he had intended; and being\n",
      "on foot, was unseen by the whole party till almost close to them. The\n",
      "terror which the woman and boy had been creating in Harriet was then\n",
      "their own portion. He had left them completely frightened; and Harriet\n",
      "eagerly clinging to him, and hardly able to speak, had just strength\n",
      "enough to reach Hartfield, before her spirits were quite overcome.\n",
      "It was his idea to bring her to Hartfield: he had thought of no other\n",
      "place.\n",
      "\n",
      "This was the amount of the whole story,--of his communication and of\n",
      "Harriet's as soon as she had recovered her senses and speech.--He dared\n",
      "not stay longer than to see her well; these several delays left him\n",
      "not another minute to lose; and Emma engaging to give assurance of her\n",
      "safety to Mrs. Goddard, and notice of there being such a set of people\n",
      "in the neighbourhood to Mr. Knightley, he set off, with all the grateful\n",
      "blessings that she could utter for her friend and herself.\n",
      "\n",
      "Such an adventure as this,--a fine young man and a lovely young woman\n",
      "thrown together in such a way, could hardly fail of suggesting certain\n",
      "ideas to the coldest heart and the steadiest brain. So Emma thought, at\n",
      "least. Could a linguist, could a grammarian, could even a mathematician\n",
      "have seen what she did, have witnessed their appearance together, and\n",
      "heard their history of it, without feeling that circumstances had been\n",
      "at work to make them peculiarly interesting to each other?--How much\n",
      "more must an imaginist, like herself, be on fire with speculation and\n",
      "foresight!--especially with such a groundwork of anticipation as her\n",
      "mind had already made.\n",

      "person, and at the very hour, when the other very person was chancing\n",
      "to pass by to rescue her!--It certainly was very extraordinary!--And\n",
      "knowing, as she did, the favourable state of mind of each at this\n",
      "period, it struck her the more. He was wishing to get the better of his\n",
      "attachment to herself, she just recovering from her mania for Mr. Elton.\n",
      "It seemed as if every thing united to promise the most interesting\n",
      "consequences. It was not possible that the occurrence should not be\n",
      "strongly recommending each to the other.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the few minutes' conversation which she had yet had with him, while\n",
      "Harriet had been partially insensible, he had spoken of her terror,\n",
      "her naivete, her fervour as she seized and clung to his arm, with a\n",
      "sensibility amused and delighted; and just at last, after Harriet's\n",
      "own account had been given, he had expressed his indignation at the\n",
      "abominable folly of Miss Bickerton in the warmest terms. Every thing was\n",
      "to take its natural course, however, neither impelled nor assisted.\n",
      "She would not stir a step, nor drop a hint. No, she had had enough of\n",
      "interference. There could be no harm in a scheme, a mere passive scheme.\n",
      "It was no more than a wish. Beyond it she would on no account proceed.\n",

      "who talk most, the young and the low; and all the youth and servants in\n",
      "the place were soon in the happiness of frightful news. The last night's\n",
      "ball seemed lost in the gipsies. Poor Mr. Woodhouse trembled as he sat,\n",
      "and, as Emma had foreseen, would scarcely be satisfied without their\n",
      "promising never to go beyond the shrubbery again. It was some comfort\n",
      "to him that many inquiries after himself and Miss Woodhouse (for his\n",

      "dwindled soon into a matter of little importance but to Emma and her\n",

      "fortune, might be proved to have made Harriet's.--About a fortnight\n",
      "after the alarm, they came to a sufficient explanation, and quite\n",
      "undesignedly. Emma was not thinking of it at the moment, which made the\n",
      "information she received more valuable. She merely said, in the course\n",

      "Eltons were still talking of a visit from the Sucklings, and of the use\n",
      "to be made of their barouche-landau; and Jane Fairfax was still at her\n",
      "grandmother's; and as the return of the Campbells from Ireland was again\n",
      "delayed, and August, instead of Midsummer, fixed for it, she was likely\n",
      "to remain there full two months longer, provided at least she were able\n",
      "to defeat Mrs. Elton's activity in her service, and save herself from\n",
      "being hurried into a delightful situation against her will.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Knightley, who, for some reason best known to himself, had certainly\n",
      "taken an early dislike to Frank Churchill, was only growing to dislike\n",
      "him more. He began to suspect him of some double dealing in his pursuit\n",
      "of Emma. That Emma was his object appeared indisputable. Every thing\n",
      "declared it; his own attentions, his father's hints, his mother-in-law's\n",
      "guarded silence; it was all in unison; words, conduct, discretion, and\n",
      "indiscretion, told the same story. But while so many were devoting him\n",
      "to Emma, and Emma herself making him over to Harriet, Mr. Knightley\n",
      "began to suspect him of some inclination to trifle with Jane Fairfax. He\n",
      "could not understand it; but there were symptoms of intelligence between\n",
      "them--he thought so at least--symptoms of admiration on his side, which,\n",
      "having once observed, he could not persuade himself to think entirely\n",
      "void of meaning, however he might wish to escape any of Emma's errors\n",
      "of imagination. _She_ was not present when the suspicion first arose.\n",
      "He was dining with the Randalls family, and Jane, at the Eltons'; and he\n",
      "had seen a look, more than a single look, at Miss Fairfax, which, from\n",
      "the admirer of Miss Woodhouse, seemed somewhat out of place. When he was\n",
      "again in their company, he could not help remembering what he had seen;\n",
      "nor could he avoid observations which, unless it were like Cowper and\n",
      "his fire at twilight,\n",
      "\n",
      "“Myself creating what I saw,”\n",
      "\n",
      "brought him yet stronger suspicion of there being a something of private\n",

      "\n",
      "He had walked up one day after dinner, as he very often did, to spend\n",
      "his evening at Hartfield. Emma and Harriet were going to walk; he joined\n",
      "them; and, on returning, they fell in with a larger party, who, like\n",
      "themselves, judged it wisest to take their exercise early, as the\n",
      "weather threatened rain; Mr. and Mrs. Weston and their son, Miss Bates\n",
      "and her niece, who had accidentally met. They all united; and, on\n",
      "reaching Hartfield gates, Emma, who knew it was exactly the sort of\n",
      "visiting that would be welcome to her father, pressed them all to go in\n",
      "and drink tea with him. The Randalls party agreed to it immediately; and\n",
      "after a pretty long speech from Miss Bates, which few persons listened\n",
      "to, she also found it possible to accept dear Miss Woodhouse's most\n",
      "obliging invitation.\n",

      "extremely happy about it. It was owing to _her_ persuasion, as she\n",
      "thought his being out in bad weather did him a great deal of harm. You\n",
      "must remember it now?”\n",

      "“Upon my word I never heard of it till this moment.”\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",

      "afford it. You had it from himself, had you?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No, sir,” replied his son, laughing, “I seem to have had it from\n",
      "nobody.--Very odd!--I really was persuaded of Mrs. Weston's having\n",
      "mentioned it in one of her letters to Enscombe, many weeks ago, with all\n",
      "these particulars--but as she declares she never heard a syllable of\n",
      "it before, of course it must have been a dream. I am a great dreamer.\n",
      "I dream of every body at Highbury when I am away--and when I have gone\n",

      "Perry.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It is odd though,” observed his father, “that you should have had such\n",
      "a regular connected dream about people whom it was not very likely you\n",
      "should be thinking of at Enscombe. Perry's setting up his carriage! and\n",
      "his wife's persuading him to it, out of care for his health--just\n",
      "what will happen, I have no doubt, some time or other; only a little\n",
      "premature. What an air of probability sometimes runs through a dream!\n",
      "And at others, what a heap of absurdities it is! Well, Frank, your dream\n",
      "certainly shews that Highbury is in your thoughts when you are absent.\n",
      "Emma, you are a great dreamer, I think?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Emma was out of hearing. She had hurried on before her guests to\n",

      "Weston's hint.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why, to own the truth,” cried Miss Bates, who had been trying in vain\n",
      "to be heard the last two minutes, “if I must speak on this subject,\n",
      "there is no denying that Mr. Frank Churchill might have--I do not mean\n",
      "to say that he did not dream it--I am sure I have sometimes the oddest\n",
      "dreams in the world--but if I am questioned about it, I must acknowledge\n",
      "that there was such an idea last spring; for Mrs. Perry herself\n",
      "mentioned it to my mother, and the Coles knew of it as well as\n",
      "ourselves--but it was quite a secret, known to nobody else, and only\n",
      "thought of about three days. Mrs. Perry was very anxious that he should\n",
      "have a carriage, and came to my mother in great spirits one morning\n",
      "because she thought she had prevailed. Jane, don't you remember\n",
      "grandmama's telling us of it when we got home? I forget where we\n",
      "had been walking to--very likely to Randalls; yes, I think it was to\n",
      "Randalls. Mrs. Perry was always particularly fond of my mother--indeed\n",
      "I do not know who is not--and she had mentioned it to her in confidence;\n",
      "she had no objection to her telling us, of course, but it was not to go\n",
      "beyond: and, from that day to this, I never mentioned it to a soul that\n",
      "I know of. At the same time, I will not positively answer for my having\n",
      "never dropt a hint, because I know I do sometimes pop out a thing before\n",
      "I am aware. I am a talker, you know; I am rather a talker; and now and\n",
      "then I have let a thing escape me which I should not. I am not like\n",
      "Jane; I wish I were. I will answer for it _she_ never betrayed the least\n",

      "Bates's in a glance at Jane. From Frank Churchill's face, where\n",
      "he thought he saw confusion suppressed or laughed away, he had\n",
      "involuntarily turned to hers; but she was indeed behind, and too busy\n",
      "with her shawl. Mr. Weston had walked in. The two other gentlemen waited\n",
      "at the door to let her pass. Mr. Knightley suspected in Frank\n",
      "Churchill the determination of catching her eye--he seemed watching her\n",
      "intently--in vain, however, if it were so--Jane passed between them\n",
      "into the hall, and looked at neither.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was no time for farther remark or explanation. The dream must be\n",
      "borne with, and Mr. Knightley must take his seat with the rest round the\n",
      "large modern circular table which Emma had introduced at Hartfield, and\n",
      "which none but Emma could have had power to place there and persuade her\n",
      "father to use, instead of the small-sized Pembroke, on which two of his\n",
      "daily meals had, for forty years been crowded. Tea passed pleasantly,\n",
      "and nobody seemed in a hurry to move.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Miss Woodhouse,” said Frank Churchill, after examining a table behind\n",
      "him, which he could reach as he sat, “have your nephews taken away their\n",
      "alphabets--their box of letters? It used to stand here. Where is it?\n",
      "This is a sort of dull-looking evening, that ought to be treated rather\n",
      "as winter than summer. We had great amusement with those letters one\n",
      "morning. I want to puzzle you again.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Emma was pleased with the thought; and producing the box, the table\n",
      "was quickly scattered over with alphabets, which no one seemed so much\n",
      "disposed to employ as their two selves. They were rapidly forming words\n",
      "for each other, or for any body else who would be puzzled. The quietness\n",
      "of the game made it particularly eligible for Mr. Woodhouse, who had\n",
      "often been distressed by the more animated sort, which Mr. Weston had\n",
      "occasionally introduced, and who now sat happily occupied in lamenting,\n",
      "with tender melancholy, over the departure of the “poor little boys,”\n",
      " or in fondly pointing out, as he took up any stray letter near him, how\n",
      "beautifully Emma had written it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Frank Churchill placed a word before Miss Fairfax. She gave a slight\n",
      "glance round the table, and applied herself to it. Frank was next to\n",
      "Emma, Jane opposite to them--and Mr. Knightley so placed as to see them\n",
      "all; and it was his object to see as much as he could, with as little\n",
      "apparent observation. The word was discovered, and with a faint smile\n",
      "pushed away. If meant to be immediately mixed with the others, and\n",
      "buried from sight, she should have looked on the table instead of\n",
      "looking just across, for it was not mixed; and Harriet, eager after\n",
      "every fresh word, and finding out none, directly took it up, and fell to\n",
      "work. She was sitting by Mr. Knightley, and turned to him for help. The\n",
      "word was _blunder_; and as Harriet exultingly proclaimed it, there was a\n",
      "blush on Jane's cheek which gave it a meaning not otherwise ostensible.\n",
      "Mr. Knightley connected it with the dream; but how it could all be,\n",
      "was beyond his comprehension. How the delicacy, the discretion of his\n",
      "favourite could have been so lain asleep! He feared there must be some\n",
      "decided involvement. Disingenuousness and double dealing seemed to meet\n",
      "him at every turn. These letters were but the vehicle for gallantry and\n",
      "trick. It was a child's play, chosen to conceal a deeper game on Frank\n",
      "Churchill's part.\n",
      "\n",
      "With great indignation did he continue to observe him; with great alarm\n",
      "and distrust, to observe also his two blinded companions. He saw a short\n",
      "word prepared for Emma, and given to her with a look sly and demure. He\n",
      "saw that Emma had soon made it out, and found it highly entertaining,\n",
      "though it was something which she judged it proper to appear to censure;\n",
      "for she said, “Nonsense! for shame!” He heard Frank Churchill next say,\n",
      "with a glance towards Jane, “I will give it to her--shall I?”--and as\n",
      "clearly heard Emma opposing it with eager laughing warmth. “No, no, you\n",
      "must not; you shall not, indeed.”\n",
      "\n",
      "It was done however. This gallant young man, who seemed to love without\n",
      "feeling, and to recommend himself without complaisance, directly handed\n",
      "over the word to Miss Fairfax, and with a particular degree of sedate\n",
      "civility entreated her to study it. Mr. Knightley's excessive curiosity\n",
      "to know what this word might be, made him seize every possible moment\n",
      "for darting his eye towards it, and it was not long before he saw it\n",
      "to be _Dixon_. Jane Fairfax's perception seemed to accompany his;\n",
      "her comprehension was certainly more equal to the covert meaning,\n",
      "the superior intelligence, of those five letters so arranged. She was\n",
      "evidently displeased; looked up, and seeing herself watched, blushed\n",
      "more deeply than he had ever perceived her, and saying only, “I did not\n",
      "know that proper names were allowed,” pushed away the letters with even\n",
      "an angry spirit, and looked resolved to be engaged by no other word\n",
      "that could be offered. Her face was averted from those who had made the\n",
      "attack, and turned towards her aunt.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Aye, very true, my dear,” cried the latter, though Jane had not spoken\n",
      "a word--“I was just going to say the same thing. It is time for us to be\n",
      "going indeed. The evening is closing in, and grandmama will be looking\n",
      "for us. My dear sir, you are too obliging. We really must wish you good\n",
      "night.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Jane's alertness in moving, proved her as ready as her aunt had\n",
      "preconceived. She was immediately up, and wanting to quit the table; but\n",
      "so many were also moving, that she could not get away; and Mr. Knightley\n",
      "thought he saw another collection of letters anxiously pushed towards\n",
      "her, and resolutely swept away by her unexamined. She was afterwards\n",
      "looking for her shawl--Frank Churchill was looking also--it was growing\n",
      "dusk, and the room was in confusion; and how they parted, Mr. Knightley\n",
      "could not tell.\n",
      "\n",
      "He remained at Hartfield after all the rest, his thoughts full of\n",
      "what he had seen; so full, that when the candles came to assist his\n",
      "observations, he must--yes, he certainly must, as a friend--an anxious\n",
      "friend--give Emma some hint, ask her some question. He could not see her\n",
      "in a situation of such danger, without trying to preserve her. It was\n",
      "his duty.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Pray, Emma,” said he, “may I ask in what lay the great amusement, the\n",
      "poignant sting of the last word given to you and Miss Fairfax? I saw the\n",
      "word, and am curious to know how it could be so very entertaining to the\n",
      "one, and so very distressing to the other.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Emma was extremely confused. She could not endure to give him the true\n",
      "explanation; for though her suspicions were by no means removed, she was\n",
      "really ashamed of having ever imparted them.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh!” she cried in evident embarrassment, “it all meant nothing; a mere\n",
      "joke among ourselves.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“The joke,” he replied gravely, “seemed confined to you and Mr.\n",
      "Churchill.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He had hoped she would speak again, but she did not. She would rather\n",
      "busy herself about any thing than speak. He sat a little while in\n",
      "doubt. A variety of evils crossed his mind. Interference--fruitless\n",
      "interference. Emma's confusion, and the acknowledged intimacy, seemed to\n",
      "declare her affection engaged. Yet he would speak. He owed it to her,\n",
      "to risk any thing that might be involved in an unwelcome interference,\n",
      "rather than her welfare; to encounter any thing, rather than the\n",
      "remembrance of neglect in such a cause.\n",

      "After being long fed with hopes of a speedy visit from Mr. and Mrs.\n",
      "Suckling, the Highbury world were obliged to endure the mortification\n",
      "of hearing that they could not possibly come till the autumn. No such\n",
      "importation of novelties could enrich their intellectual stores at\n",
      "present. In the daily interchange of news, they must be again restricted\n",
      "to the other topics with which for a while the Sucklings' coming had\n",
      "been united, such as the last accounts of Mrs. Churchill, whose health\n",
      "seemed every day to supply a different report, and the situation of Mrs.\n",
      "Weston, whose happiness it was to be hoped might eventually be as much\n",
      "increased by the arrival of a child, as that of all her neighbours was\n",
      "by the approach of it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Elton was very much disappointed. It was the delay of a great deal\n",
      "of pleasure and parade. Her introductions and recommendations must all\n",
      "wait, and every projected party be still only talked of. So she thought\n",
      "at first;--but a little consideration convinced her that every thing\n",
      "need not be put off. Why should not they explore to Box Hill though\n",
      "the Sucklings did not come? They could go there again with them in the\n",
      "autumn. It was settled that they should go to Box Hill. That there was\n",
      "to be such a party had been long generally known: it had even given the\n",
      "idea of another. Emma had never been to Box Hill; she wished to see what\n",
      "every body found so well worth seeing, and she and Mr. Weston had agreed\n",
      "to chuse some fine morning and drive thither. Two or three more of the\n",
      "chosen only were to be admitted to join them, and it was to be done in a\n",
      "quiet, unpretending, elegant way, infinitely superior to the bustle and\n",
      "preparation, the regular eating and drinking, and picnic parade of the\n",
      "Eltons and the Sucklings.\n",
      "\n",
      "This was so very well understood between them, that Emma could not but\n",
      "feel some surprise, and a little displeasure, on hearing from Mr. Weston\n",
      "that he had been proposing to Mrs. Elton, as her brother and sister had\n",
      "failed her, that the two parties should unite, and go together; and that\n",
      "as Mrs. Elton had very readily acceded to it, so it was to be, if she\n",
      "had no objection. Now, as her objection was nothing but her very great\n",
      "dislike of Mrs. Elton, of which Mr. Weston must already be perfectly\n",
      "aware, it was not worth bringing forward again:--it could not be done\n",
      "without a reproof to him, which would be giving pain to his wife; and\n",
      "she found herself therefore obliged to consent to an arrangement which\n",
      "she would have done a great deal to avoid; an arrangement which would\n",
      "probably expose her even to the degradation of being said to be of Mrs.\n",
      "Elton's party! Every feeling was offended; and the forbearance of her\n",
      "outward submission left a heavy arrear due of secret severity in her\n",

      "\n",
      "“I am glad you approve of what I have done,” said he very comfortably.\n",
      "“But I thought you would. Such schemes as these are nothing without\n",

      "Emma denied none of it aloud, and agreed to none of it in private.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was now the middle of June, and the weather fine; and Mrs. Elton\n",
      "was growing impatient to name the day, and settle with Mr. Weston as to\n",
      "pigeon-pies and cold lamb, when a lame carriage-horse threw every thing\n",
      "into sad uncertainty. It might be weeks, it might be only a few days,\n",
      "before the horse were useable; but no preparations could be ventured\n",
      "on, and it was all melancholy stagnation. Mrs. Elton's resources were\n",
      "inadequate to such an attack.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Is not this most vexatious, Knightley?” she cried.--“And such weather\n",
      "for exploring!--These delays and disappointments are quite odious. What\n",
      "are we to do?--The year will wear away at this rate, and nothing\n",
      "done. Before this time last year I assure you we had had a delightful\n",
      "exploring party from Maple Grove to Kings Weston.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You had better explore to Donwell,” replied Mr. Knightley. “That may\n",

      "fast.”\n",
      "\n",
      "If Mr. Knightley did not begin seriously, he was obliged to proceed so,\n",
      "for his proposal was caught at with delight; and the “Oh! I should like\n",
      "it of all things,” was not plainer in words than manner. Donwell was\n",
      "famous for its strawberry-beds, which seemed a plea for the invitation:\n",
      "but no plea was necessary; cabbage-beds would have been enough to tempt\n",
      "the lady, who only wanted to be going somewhere. She promised him again\n",
      "and again to come--much oftener than he doubted--and was extremely\n",
      "gratified by such a proof of intimacy, such a distinguishing compliment\n",
      "as she chose to consider it.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You may depend upon me,” said she. “I certainly will come. Name your\n",
      "day, and I will come. You will allow me to bring Jane Fairfax?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I cannot name a day,” said he, “till I have spoken to some others whom\n",

      "\n",

      "\n",
      "“Oh! now you are looking very sly. But consider--you need not be afraid\n",
      "of delegating power to _me_. I am no young lady on her preferment.\n",

      "it all to me. I will invite your guests.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No,”--he calmly replied,--“there is but one married woman in the world\n",
      "whom I can ever allow to invite what guests she pleases to Donwell, and\n",
      "that one is--”\n",
      "\n",
      "“--Mrs. Weston, I suppose,” interrupted Mrs. Elton, rather mortified.\n",
      "\n",
      "“No--Mrs. Knightley;--and till she is in being, I will manage such\n",
      "matters myself.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ah! you are an odd creature!” she cried, satisfied to have no one\n",
      "preferred to herself.--“You are a humourist, and may say what you\n",
      "like. Quite a humourist. Well, I shall bring Jane with me--Jane and her\n",
      "aunt.--The rest I leave to you. I have no objections at all to meeting\n",

      "\n",
      "“That's quite unnecessary; I see Jane every day:--but as you like. It\n",
      "is to be a morning scheme, you know, Knightley; quite a simple thing. I\n",
      "shall wear a large bonnet, and bring one of my little baskets hanging\n",
      "on my arm. Here,--probably this basket with pink ribbon. Nothing can be\n",
      "more simple, you see. And Jane will have such another. There is to be\n",
      "no form or parade--a sort of gipsy party. We are to walk about\n",
      "your gardens, and gather the strawberries ourselves, and sit under\n",
      "trees;--and whatever else you may like to provide, it is to be all out\n",
      "of doors--a table spread in the shade, you know. Every thing as natural\n",
      "and simple as possible. Is not that your idea?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Not quite. My idea of the simple and the natural will be to have\n",
      "the table spread in the dining-room. The nature and the simplicity of\n",
      "gentlemen and ladies, with their servants and furniture, I think is\n",
      "best observed by meals within doors. When you are tired of eating\n",
      "strawberries in the garden, there shall be cold meat in the house.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well--as you please; only don't have a great set out. And, by the bye,\n",
      "can I or my housekeeper be of any use to you with our opinion?--Pray be\n",
      "sincere, Knightley. If you wish me to talk to Mrs. Hodges, or to inspect\n",
      "anything--”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I have not the least wish for it, I thank you.”\n",

      "would spurn any body's assistance.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I wish we had a donkey. The thing would be for us all to come on\n",
      "donkeys, Jane, Miss Bates, and me--and my caro sposo walking by. I\n",
      "really must talk to him about purchasing a donkey. In a country life\n",
      "I conceive it to be a sort of necessary; for, let a woman have ever\n",
      "so many resources, it is not possible for her to be always shut up at\n",
      "home;--and very long walks, you know--in summer there is dust, and in\n",
      "winter there is dirt.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You will not find either, between Donwell and Highbury. Donwell Lane is\n",
      "never dusty, and now it is perfectly dry. Come on a donkey, however, if\n",
      "you prefer it. You can borrow Mrs. Cole's. I would wish every thing to\n",
      "be as much to your taste as possible.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“That I am sure you would. Indeed I do you justice, my good friend.\n",
      "Under that peculiar sort of dry, blunt manner, I know you have the\n",
      "warmest heart. As I tell Mr. E., you are a thorough humourist.--Yes,\n",
      "believe me, Knightley, I am fully sensible of your attention to me in\n",

      "me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Knightley had another reason for avoiding a table in the shade. He\n",
      "wished to persuade Mr. Woodhouse, as well as Emma, to join the party;\n",
      "and he knew that to have any of them sitting down out of doors to\n",
      "eat would inevitably make him ill. Mr. Woodhouse must not, under the\n",
      "specious pretence of a morning drive, and an hour or two spent at\n",
      "Donwell, be tempted away to his misery.\n",
      "\n",
      "He was invited on good faith. No lurking horrors were to upbraid him for\n",
      "his easy credulity. He did consent. He had not been at Donwell for two\n",
      "years. “Some very fine morning, he, and Emma, and Harriet, could go\n",
      "very well; and he could sit still with Mrs. Weston, while the dear girls\n",
      "walked about the gardens. He did not suppose they could be damp now,\n",
      "in the middle of the day. He should like to see the old house again\n",
      "exceedingly, and should be very happy to meet Mr. and Mrs. Elton, and\n",
      "any other of his neighbours.--He could not see any objection at all to\n",
      "his, and Emma's, and Harriet's going there some very fine morning. He\n",
      "thought it very well done of Mr. Knightley to invite them--very kind\n",
      "and sensible--much cleverer than dining out.--He was not fond of dining\n",
      "out.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Knightley was fortunate in every body's most ready concurrence. The\n",
      "invitation was everywhere so well received, that it seemed as if, like\n",
      "Mrs. Elton, they were all taking the scheme as a particular compliment\n",
      "to themselves.--Emma and Harriet professed very high expectations of\n",
      "pleasure from it; and Mr. Weston, unasked, promised to get Frank over to\n",
      "join them, if possible; a proof of approbation and gratitude which could\n",
      "have been dispensed with.--Mr. Knightley was then obliged to say that\n",
      "he should be glad to see him; and Mr. Weston engaged to lose no time in\n",
      "writing, and spare no arguments to induce him to come.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the meanwhile the lame horse recovered so fast, that the party to\n",
      "Box Hill was again under happy consideration; and at last Donwell was\n",
      "settled for one day, and Box Hill for the next,--the weather appearing\n",
      "exactly right.\n",
      "\n",
      "Under a bright mid-day sun, at almost Midsummer, Mr. Woodhouse was\n",
      "safely conveyed in his carriage, with one window down, to partake of\n",
      "this al-fresco party; and in one of the most comfortable rooms in the\n",
      "Abbey, especially prepared for him by a fire all the morning, he was\n",
      "happily placed, quite at his ease, ready to talk with pleasure of what\n",
      "had been achieved, and advise every body to come and sit down, and not\n",
      "to heat themselves.--Mrs. Weston, who seemed to have walked there on\n",
      "purpose to be tired, and sit all the time with him, remained, when\n",
      "all the others were invited or persuaded out, his patient listener and\n",
      "sympathiser.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was so long since Emma had been at the Abbey, that as soon as she was\n",
      "satisfied of her father's comfort, she was glad to leave him, and look\n",
      "around her; eager to refresh and correct her memory with more particular\n",
      "observation, more exact understanding of a house and grounds which must\n",
      "ever be so interesting to her and all her family.\n",
      "\n",
      "She felt all the honest pride and complacency which her alliance with\n",
      "the present and future proprietor could fairly warrant, as she viewed\n",
      "the respectable size and style of the building, its suitable, becoming,\n",
      "characteristic situation, low and sheltered--its ample gardens\n",
      "stretching down to meadows washed by a stream, of which the Abbey, with\n",
      "all the old neglect of prospect, had scarcely a sight--and its abundance\n",
      "of timber in rows and avenues, which neither fashion nor extravagance\n",
      "had rooted up.--The house was larger than Hartfield, and totally unlike\n",
      "it, covering a good deal of ground, rambling and irregular, with many\n",
      "comfortable, and one or two handsome rooms.--It was just what it ought\n",
      "to be, and it looked what it was--and Emma felt an increasing respect\n",
      "for it, as the residence of a family of such true gentility, untainted\n",
      "in blood and understanding.--Some faults of temper John Knightley had;\n",
      "but Isabella had connected herself unexceptionably. She had given them\n",
      "neither men, nor names, nor places, that could raise a blush. These were\n",
      "pleasant feelings, and she walked about and indulged them till it\n",
      "was necessary to do as the others did, and collect round the\n",
      "strawberry-beds.--The whole party were assembled, excepting Frank\n",
      "Churchill, who was expected every moment from Richmond; and Mrs. Elton,\n",
      "in all her apparatus of happiness, her large bonnet and her basket,\n",
      "was very ready to lead the way in gathering, accepting, or\n",
      "talking--strawberries, and only strawberries, could now be thought or\n",
      "spoken of.--“The best fruit in England--every body's favourite--always\n",
      "wholesome.--These the finest beds and finest sorts.--Delightful to\n",
      "gather for one's self--the only way of really enjoying them.--Morning\n",
      "decidedly the best time--never tired--every sort good--hautboy\n",
      "infinitely superior--no comparison--the others hardly eatable--hautboys\n",
      "very scarce--Chili preferred--white wood finest flavour of all--price\n",
      "of strawberries in London--abundance about Bristol--Maple\n",
      "Grove--cultivation--beds when to be renewed--gardeners thinking exactly\n",
      "different--no general rule--gardeners never to be put out of their\n",
      "way--delicious fruit--only too rich to be eaten much of--inferior\n",
      "to cherries--currants more refreshing--only objection to gathering\n",
      "strawberries the stooping--glaring sun--tired to death--could bear it no\n",
      "longer--must go and sit in the shade.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Such, for half an hour, was the conversation--interrupted only once by\n",
      "Mrs. Weston, who came out, in her solicitude after her son-in-law, to\n",
      "inquire if he were come--and she was a little uneasy.--She had some\n",
      "fears of his horse.\n",
      "\n",
      "Seats tolerably in the shade were found; and now Emma was obliged\n",
      "to overhear what Mrs. Elton and Jane Fairfax were talking of.--A\n",
      "situation, a most desirable situation, was in question. Mrs. Elton had\n",
      "received notice of it that morning, and was in raptures. It was not\n",
      "with Mrs. Suckling, it was not with Mrs. Bragge, but in felicity and\n",
      "splendour it fell short only of them: it was with a cousin of Mrs.\n",
      "Bragge, an acquaintance of Mrs. Suckling, a lady known at Maple Grove.\n",
      "Delightful, charming, superior, first circles, spheres, lines, ranks,\n",
      "every thing--and Mrs. Elton was wild to have the offer closed with\n",
      "immediately.--On her side, all was warmth, energy, and triumph--and she\n",
      "positively refused to take her friend's negative, though Miss Fairfax\n",
      "continued to assure her that she would not at present engage in any\n",
      "thing, repeating the same motives which she had been heard to urge\n",
      "before.--Still Mrs. Elton insisted on being authorised to write an\n",
      "acquiescence by the morrow's post.--How Jane could bear it at all, was\n",
      "astonishing to Emma.--She did look vexed, she did speak pointedly--and\n",
      "at last, with a decision of action unusual to her, proposed a\n",
      "removal.--“Should not they walk? Would not Mr. Knightley shew them the\n",
      "gardens--all the gardens?--She wished to see the whole extent.”--The\n",
      "pertinacity of her friend seemed more than she could bear.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was hot; and after walking some time over the gardens in a scattered,\n",
      "dispersed way, scarcely any three together, they insensibly followed one\n",
      "another to the delicious shade of a broad short avenue of limes, which\n",
      "stretching beyond the garden at an equal distance from the river, seemed\n",
      "the finish of the pleasure grounds.--It led to nothing; nothing but a\n",
      "view at the end over a low stone wall with high pillars, which seemed\n",
      "intended, in their erection, to give the appearance of an approach to\n",
      "the house, which never had been there. Disputable, however, as might be\n",
      "the taste of such a termination, it was in itself a charming walk, and\n",
      "the view which closed it extremely pretty.--The considerable slope, at\n",
      "nearly the foot of which the Abbey stood, gradually acquired a steeper\n",
      "form beyond its grounds; and at half a mile distant was a bank of\n",
      "considerable abruptness and grandeur, well clothed with wood;--and at\n",
      "the bottom of this bank, favourably placed and sheltered, rose the\n",
      "Abbey Mill Farm, with meadows in front, and the river making a close and\n",
      "handsome curve around it.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was a sweet view--sweet to the eye and the mind. English verdure,\n",
      "English culture, English comfort, seen under a sun bright, without being\n",
      "oppressive.\n",
      "\n",
      "In this walk Emma and Mr. Weston found all the others assembled; and\n",
      "towards this view she immediately perceived Mr. Knightley and Harriet\n",
      "distinct from the rest, quietly leading the way. Mr. Knightley and\n",
      "Harriet!--It was an odd tete-a-tete; but she was glad to see it.--There\n",
      "had been a time when he would have scorned her as a companion, and\n",
      "turned from her with little ceremony. Now they seemed in pleasant\n",
      "conversation. There had been a time also when Emma would have been sorry\n",
      "to see Harriet in a spot so favourable for the Abbey Mill Farm; but now\n",
      "she feared it not. It might be safely viewed with all its appendages of\n",
      "prosperity and beauty, its rich pastures, spreading flocks, orchard in\n",
      "blossom, and light column of smoke ascending.--She joined them at the\n",
      "wall, and found them more engaged in talking than in looking around. He\n",
      "was giving Harriet information as to modes of agriculture, etc. and Emma\n",
      "received a smile which seemed to say, “These are my own concerns. I have\n",
      "a right to talk on such subjects, without being suspected of\n",

      "uneasy, and laughed at her fears; but she could not be cured of wishing\n",
      "that he would part with his black mare. He had expressed himself as to\n",
      "coming, with more than common certainty. “His aunt was so much better,\n",
      "that he had not a doubt of getting over to them.”--Mrs. Churchill's\n",
      "state, however, as many were ready to remind her, was liable to such\n",
      "sudden variation as might disappoint her nephew in the most reasonable\n",
      "dependence--and Mrs. Weston was at last persuaded to believe, or to say,\n",
      "that it must be by some attack of Mrs. Churchill that he was\n",

      "shells, and every other family collection within his cabinets, had been\n",
      "prepared for his old friend, to while away the morning; and the kindness\n",
      "had perfectly answered. Mr. Woodhouse had been exceedingly well amused.\n",
      "Mrs. Weston had been shewing them all to him, and now he would shew them\n",
      "all to Emma;--fortunate in having no other resemblance to a child, than\n",
      "in a total want of taste for what he saw, for he was slow, constant, and\n",

      "the entrance and ground-plot of the house--and was hardly there, when\n",
      "Jane Fairfax appeared, coming quickly in from the garden, and with a\n",

      "grateful--and her parting words, “Oh! Miss Woodhouse, the comfort of\n",

      "how late, with all his hurry, he must be, he believed he should not have\n",
      "come at all. The heat was excessive; he had never suffered any thing\n",
      "like it--almost wished he had staid at home--nothing killed him\n",

      "They had a very fine day for Box Hill; and all the other outward\n",
      "circumstances of arrangement, accommodation, and punctuality, were in\n",
      "favour of a pleasant party. Mr. Weston directed the whole, officiating\n",
      "safely between Hartfield and the Vicarage, and every body was in good\n",
      "time. Emma and Harriet went together; Miss Bates and her niece, with\n",
      "the Eltons; the gentlemen on horseback. Mrs. Weston remained with Mr.\n",
      "Woodhouse. Nothing was wanting but to be happy when they got there.\n",
      "Seven miles were travelled in expectation of enjoyment, and every body\n",
      "had a burst of admiration on first arriving; but in the general amount\n",
      "of the day there was deficiency. There was a languor, a want of spirits,\n",
      "a want of union, which could not be got over. They separated too much\n",
      "into parties. The Eltons walked together; Mr. Knightley took charge of\n",
      "Miss Bates and Jane; and Emma and Harriet belonged to Frank Churchill.\n",
      "And Mr. Weston tried, in vain, to make them harmonise better. It seemed\n",
      "at first an accidental division, but it never materially varied. Mr. and\n",
      "Mrs. Elton, indeed, shewed no unwillingness to mix, and be as agreeable\n",
      "as they could; but during the two whole hours that were spent on the\n",
      "hill, there seemed a principle of separation, between the other parties,\n",
      "too strong for any fine prospects, or any cold collation, or any\n",
      "cheerful Mr. Weston, to remove.\n",
      "\n",
      "At first it was downright dulness to Emma. She had never seen Frank\n",
      "Churchill so silent and stupid. He said nothing worth hearing--looked\n",
      "without seeing--admired without intelligence--listened without knowing\n",
      "what she said. While he was so dull, it was no wonder that Harriet\n",
      "should be dull likewise; and they were both insufferable.\n",
      "\n",
      "When they all sat down it was better; to her taste a great deal better,\n",
      "for Frank Churchill grew talkative and gay, making her his first object.\n",
      "Every distinguishing attention that could be paid, was paid to her.\n",
      "To amuse her, and be agreeable in her eyes, seemed all that he cared\n",
      "for--and Emma, glad to be enlivened, not sorry to be flattered, was gay\n",
      "and easy too, and gave him all the friendly encouragement, the admission\n",
      "to be gallant, which she had ever given in the first and most animating\n",
      "period of their acquaintance; but which now, in her own estimation,\n",
      "meant nothing, though in the judgment of most people looking on it must\n",
      "have had such an appearance as no English word but flirtation could very\n",
      "well describe. “Mr. Frank Churchill and Miss Woodhouse flirted together\n",
      "excessively.” They were laying themselves open to that very phrase--and\n",
      "to having it sent off in a letter to Maple Grove by one lady, to\n",
      "Ireland by another. Not that Emma was gay and thoughtless from any\n",
      "real felicity; it was rather because she felt less happy than she had\n",
      "expected. She laughed because she was disappointed; and though she liked\n",
      "him for his attentions, and thought them all, whether in friendship,\n",

      "a morning more completely misspent, more totally bare of rational\n",
      "satisfaction at the time, and more to be abhorred in recollection, than\n",
      "any she had ever passed. A whole evening of back-gammon with her father,\n",
      "was felicity to it. _There_, indeed, lay real pleasure, for there she\n",

      "feeling that, unmerited as might be the degree of his fond affection and\n",
      "confiding esteem, she could not, in her general conduct, be open to any\n",

      "her conscience told her so; remiss, perhaps, more in thought than fact;\n",
      "scornful, ungracious. But it should be so no more. In the warmth of true\n",

      "\n",
      "She was just as determined when the morrow came, and went early, that\n",

      "before tea, but not that. Mr. Elton was called out of the room before\n",

      "himself, you know, being head man at the Crown, ostler, and every thing\n",
      "of that sort, but still he cannot keep his father without some help;\n",
      "and so, when Mr. Elton came back, he told us what John ostler had been\n",
      "telling him, and then it came out about the chaise having been sent to\n",
      "Randalls to take Mr. Frank Churchill to Richmond. That was what happened\n",

      "going, she proceeded to give them all, it was of no consequence.\n",
      "\n",
      "What Mr. Elton had learned from the ostler on the subject, being the\n",
      "accumulation of the ostler's own knowledge, and the knowledge of the\n",
      "servants at Randalls, was, that a messenger had come over from Richmond\n",
      "soon after the return of the party from Box Hill--which messenger,\n",
      "however, had been no more than was expected; and that Mr. Churchill had\n",
      "sent his nephew a few lines, containing, upon the whole, a tolerable\n",
      "account of Mrs. Churchill, and only wishing him not to delay coming\n",
      "back beyond the next morning early; but that Mr. Frank Churchill having\n",
      "resolved to go home directly, without waiting at all, and his horse\n",
      "seeming to have got a cold, Tom had been sent off immediately for the\n",

      "going a good pace, and driving very steady.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was nothing in all this either to astonish or interest, and it\n",
      "caught Emma's attention only as it united with the subject which already\n",
      "engaged her mind. The contrast between Mrs. Churchill's importance in\n",
      "the world, and Jane Fairfax's, struck her; one was every thing, the\n",
      "other nothing--and she sat musing on the difference of woman's destiny,\n",

      "\n",
      "“Aye, I see what you are thinking of, the pianoforte. What is to become\n",
      "of that?--Very true. Poor dear Jane was talking of it just now.--'You\n",

      "but on entering the parlour, she found those who must rouse her. Mr.\n",
      "Knightley and Harriet had arrived during her absence, and were sitting\n",
      "with her father.--Mr. Knightley immediately got up, and in a manner\n",
      "decidedly graver than usual, said,\n",
      "\n",
      "“I would not go away without seeing you, but I have no time to spare,\n",
      "and therefore must now be gone directly. I am going to London, to spend\n",

      "Emma was sure he had not forgiven her; he looked unlike himself. Time,\n",
      "however, she thought, would tell him that they ought to be friends\n",

      "began his inquiries.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, my dear, and did you get there safely?--And how did you find my\n",
      "worthy old friend and her daughter?--I dare say they must have been very\n",
      "much obliged to you for coming. Dear Emma has been to call on Mrs.\n",
      "and Miss Bates, Mr. Knightley, as I told you before. She is always so\n",
      "attentive to them!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Emma's colour was heightened by this unjust praise; and with a\n",
      "smile, and shake of the head, which spoke much, she looked at Mr.\n",
      "Knightley.--It seemed as if there were an instantaneous impression in\n",
      "her favour, as if his eyes received the truth from hers, and all that\n",
      "had passed of good in her feelings were at once caught and honoured.--\n",
      "He looked at her with a glow of regard. She was warmly gratified--and in\n",
      "another moment still more so, by a little movement of more than common\n",
      "friendliness on his part.--He took her hand;--whether she had not\n",
      "herself made the first motion, she could not say--she might, perhaps,\n",
      "have rather offered it--but he took her hand, pressed it, and certainly\n",
      "was on the point of carrying it to his lips--when, from some fancy or\n",
      "other, he suddenly let it go.--Why he should feel such a scruple, why\n",
      "he should change his mind when it was all but done, she could not\n",
      "perceive.--He would have judged better, she thought, if he had not\n",
      "stopped.--The intention, however, was indubitable; and whether it was\n",
      "that his manners had in general so little gallantry, or however else it\n",
      "happened, but she thought nothing became him more.--It was with him,\n",
      "of so simple, yet so dignified a nature.--She could not but recall the\n",
      "attempt with great satisfaction. It spoke such perfect amity.--He left\n",
      "them immediately afterwards--gone in a moment. He always moved with the\n",
      "alertness of a mind which could neither be undecided nor dilatory, but\n",
      "now he seemed more sudden than usual in his disappearance.\n",
      "\n",
      "Emma could not regret her having gone to Miss Bates, but she wished she\n",
      "had left her ten minutes earlier;--it would have been a great pleasure\n",
      "to talk over Jane Fairfax's situation with Mr. Knightley.--Neither\n",
      "would she regret that he should be going to Brunswick Square, for she\n",
      "knew how much his visit would be enjoyed--but it might have happened\n",
      "at a better time--and to have had longer notice of it, would have been\n",
      "pleasanter.--They parted thorough friends, however; she could not\n",
      "be deceived as to the meaning of his countenance, and his unfinished\n",
      "gallantry;--it was all done to assure her that she had fully recovered\n",
      "his good opinion.--He had been sitting with them half an hour, she\n",

      "of Mr. Knightley's going to London; and going so suddenly; and going on\n",
      "horseback, which she knew would be all very bad; Emma communicated her\n",
      "news of Jane Fairfax, and her dependence on the effect was justified;\n",
      "it supplied a very useful check,--interested, without disturbing him. He\n",
      "had long made up his mind to Jane Fairfax's going out as governess, and\n",
      "could talk of it cheerfully, but Mr. Knightley's going to London had\n",

      "\n",
      "The following day brought news from Richmond to throw every thing else\n",
      "into the background. An express arrived at Randalls to announce the\n",
      "death of Mrs. Churchill! Though her nephew had had no particular reason\n",
      "to hasten back on her account, she had not lived above six-and-thirty\n",
      "hours after his return. A sudden seizure of a different nature from any\n",
      "thing foreboded by her general state, had carried her off after a short\n",
      "struggle. The great Mrs. Churchill was no more.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was felt as such things must be felt. Every body had a degree of\n",
      "gravity and sorrow; tenderness towards the departed, solicitude for the\n",
      "surviving friends; and, in a reasonable time, curiosity to know where\n",
      "she would be buried. Goldsmith tells us, that when lovely woman stoops\n",
      "to folly, she has nothing to do but to die; and when she stoops to be\n",
      "disagreeable, it is equally to be recommended as a clearer of ill-fame.\n",
      "Mrs. Churchill, after being disliked at least twenty-five years, was\n",
      "now spoken of with compassionate allowances. In one point she was fully\n",
      "justified. She had never been admitted before to be seriously ill. The\n",
      "event acquitted her of all the fancifulness, and all the selfishness of\n",
      "imaginary complaints.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Poor Mrs. Churchill! no doubt she had been suffering a great deal:\n",
      "more than any body had ever supposed--and continual pain would try the\n",
      "temper. It was a sad event--a great shock--with all her faults, what\n",
      "would Mr. Churchill do without her? Mr. Churchill's loss would be\n",
      "dreadful indeed. Mr. Churchill would never get over it.”--Even Mr.\n",
      "Weston shook his head, and looked solemn, and said, “Ah! poor woman,\n",
      "who would have thought it!” and resolved, that his mourning should be as\n",
      "handsome as possible; and his wife sat sighing and moralising over her\n",
      "broad hems with a commiseration and good sense, true and steady. How it\n",
      "would affect Frank was among the earliest thoughts of both. It was also\n",
      "a very early speculation with Emma. The character of Mrs. Churchill,\n",
      "the grief of her husband--her mind glanced over them both with awe and\n",
      "compassion--and then rested with lightened feelings on how Frank might\n",
      "be affected by the event, how benefited, how freed. She saw in a moment\n",
      "all the possible good. Now, an attachment to Harriet Smith would have\n",
      "nothing to encounter. Mr. Churchill, independent of his wife, was feared\n",
      "by nobody; an easy, guidable man, to be persuaded into any thing by his\n",
      "nephew. All that remained to be wished was, that the nephew should form\n",
      "the attachment, as, with all her goodwill in the cause, Emma could feel\n",
      "no certainty of its being already formed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Harriet behaved extremely well on the occasion, with great self-command.\n",
      "What ever she might feel of brighter hope, she betrayed nothing. Emma\n",
      "was gratified, to observe such a proof in her of strengthened character,\n",
      "and refrained from any allusion that might endanger its maintenance.\n",
      "They spoke, therefore, of Mrs. Churchill's death with mutual\n",
      "forbearance.\n",
      "\n",
      "Short letters from Frank were received at Randalls, communicating all\n",
      "that was immediately important of their state and plans. Mr. Churchill\n",
      "was better than could be expected; and their first removal, on the\n",
      "departure of the funeral for Yorkshire, was to be to the house of a very\n",
      "old friend in Windsor, to whom Mr. Churchill had been promising a\n",
      "visit the last ten years. At present, there was nothing to be done for\n",
      "Harriet; good wishes for the future were all that could yet be possible\n",
      "on Emma's side.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was a more pressing concern to shew attention to Jane Fairfax, whose\n",
      "prospects were closing, while Harriet's opened, and whose engagements\n",
      "now allowed of no delay in any one at Highbury, who wished to shew her\n",
      "kindness--and with Emma it was grown into a first wish. She had scarcely\n",
      "a stronger regret than for her past coldness; and the person, whom she\n",
      "had been so many months neglecting, was now the very one on whom she\n",
      "would have lavished every distinction of regard or sympathy. She wanted\n",
      "to be of use to her; wanted to shew a value for her society, and testify\n",
      "respect and consideration. She resolved to prevail on her to spend a day\n",
      "at Hartfield. A note was written to urge it. The invitation was refused,\n",
      "and by a verbal message. “Miss Fairfax was not well enough to write;”\n",
      " and when Mr. Perry called at Hartfield, the same morning, it appeared\n",
      "that she was so much indisposed as to have been visited, though against\n",
      "her own consent, by himself, and that she was suffering under severe\n",
      "headaches, and a nervous fever to a degree, which made him doubt the\n",
      "possibility of her going to Mrs. Smallridge's at the time proposed.\n",
      "Her health seemed for the moment completely deranged--appetite quite\n",
      "gone--and though there were no absolutely alarming symptoms, nothing\n",
      "touching the pulmonary complaint, which was the standing apprehension\n",
      "of the family, Mr. Perry was uneasy about her. He thought she had\n",
      "undertaken more than she was equal to, and that she felt it so herself,\n",
      "though she would not own it. Her spirits seemed overcome. Her\n",
      "present home, he could not but observe, was unfavourable to a nervous\n",
      "disorder:--confined always to one room;--he could have wished it\n",
      "otherwise--and her good aunt, though his very old friend, he must\n",
      "acknowledge to be not the best companion for an invalid of that\n",
      "description. Her care and attention could not be questioned; they were,\n",
      "in fact, only too great. He very much feared that Miss Fairfax derived\n",
      "more evil than good from them. Emma listened with the warmest concern;\n",
      "grieved for her more and more, and looked around eager to discover some\n",
      "way of being useful. To take her--be it only an hour or two--from\n",
      "her aunt, to give her change of air and scene, and quiet rational\n",
      "conversation, even for an hour or two, might do her good; and the\n",
      "following morning she wrote again to say, in the most feeling language\n",
      "she could command, that she would call for her in the carriage at any\n",
      "hour that Jane would name--mentioning that she had Mr. Perry's decided\n",
      "opinion, in favour of such exercise for his patient. The answer was only\n",
      "in this short note:\n",
      "\n",
      "“Miss Fairfax's compliments and thanks, but is quite unequal to any\n",
      "exercise.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Emma felt that her own note had deserved something better; but it was\n",
      "impossible to quarrel with words, whose tremulous inequality shewed\n",
      "indisposition so plainly, and she thought only of how she might best\n",
      "counteract this unwillingness to be seen or assisted. In spite of the\n",
      "answer, therefore, she ordered the carriage, and drove to Mrs. Bates's,\n",
      "in the hope that Jane would be induced to join her--but it would not\n",
      "do;--Miss Bates came to the carriage door, all gratitude, and agreeing\n",
      "with her most earnestly in thinking an airing might be of the greatest\n",
      "service--and every thing that message could do was tried--but all in\n",
      "vain. Miss Bates was obliged to return without success; Jane was\n",
      "quite unpersuadable; the mere proposal of going out seemed to make her\n",
      "worse.--Emma wished she could have seen her, and tried her own powers;\n",
      "but, almost before she could hint the wish, Miss Bates made it appear\n",
      "that she had promised her niece on no account to let Miss Woodhouse in.\n",
      "“Indeed, the truth was, that poor dear Jane could not bear to see any\n",
      "body--any body at all--Mrs. Elton, indeed, could not be denied--and\n",
      "Mrs. Cole had made such a point--and Mrs. Perry had said so much--but,\n",
      "except them, Jane would really see nobody.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Emma did not want to be classed with the Mrs. Eltons, the Mrs. Perrys,\n",
      "and the Mrs. Coles, who would force themselves anywhere; neither could\n",
      "she feel any right of preference herself--she submitted, therefore, and\n",
      "only questioned Miss Bates farther as to her niece's appetite and diet,\n",
      "which she longed to be able to assist. On that subject poor Miss Bates\n",
      "was very unhappy, and very communicative; Jane would hardly eat any\n",
      "thing:--Mr. Perry recommended nourishing food; but every thing\n",
      "they could command (and never had any body such good neighbours) was\n",
      "distasteful.\n",

      "an hour the arrowroot was returned, with a thousand thanks from Miss\n",
      "Bates, but “dear Jane would not be satisfied without its being sent\n",

      "she could have no doubt--putting every thing together--that Jane was\n",
      "resolved to receive no kindness from _her_. She was sorry, very sorry.\n",
      "Her heart was grieved for a state which seemed but the more pitiable\n",

      "being able to say to herself, that could Mr. Knightley have been privy\n",

      "One morning, about ten days after Mrs. Churchill's decease, Emma was\n",
      "called downstairs to Mr. Weston, who “could not stay five minutes,\n",
      "and wanted particularly to speak with her.”--He met her at the\n",
      "parlour-door, and hardly asking her how she did, in the natural key of\n",
      "his voice, sunk it immediately, to say, unheard by her father,\n",
      "\n",
      "“Can you come to Randalls at any time this morning?--Do, if it be\n",
      "possible. Mrs. Weston wants to see you. She must see you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Is she unwell?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No, no, not at all--only a little agitated. She would have ordered the\n",
      "carriage, and come to you, but she must see you _alone_, and that you\n",
      "know--(nodding towards her father)--Humph!--Can you come?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Certainly. This moment, if you please. It is impossible to refuse what\n",
      "you ask in such a way. But what can be the matter?--Is she really not\n",
      "ill?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Depend upon me--but ask no more questions. You will know it all in\n",
      "time. The most unaccountable business! But hush, hush!”\n",
      "\n",
      "To guess what all this meant, was impossible even for Emma. Something\n",
      "really important seemed announced by his looks; but, as her friend was\n",
      "well, she endeavoured not to be uneasy, and settling it with her father,\n",
      "that she would take her walk now, she and Mr. Weston were soon out of\n",
      "the house together and on their way at a quick pace for Randalls.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Now,”--said Emma, when they were fairly beyond the sweep gates,--“now\n",
      "Mr. Weston, do let me know what has happened.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No, no,”--he gravely replied.--“Don't ask me. I promised my wife to\n",
      "leave it all to her. She will break it to you better than I can. Do not\n",
      "be impatient, Emma; it will all come out too soon.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Break it to me,” cried Emma, standing still with terror.--“Good\n",
      "God!--Mr. Weston, tell me at once.--Something has happened in Brunswick\n",
      "Square. I know it has. Tell me, I charge you tell me this moment what it\n",
      "is.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No, indeed you are mistaken.”--\n",
      "\n",
      "“Mr. Weston do not trifle with me.--Consider how many of my dearest\n",

      "by all that is sacred, not to attempt concealment.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Upon my word, Emma.”--\n",
      "\n",
      "“Your word!--why not your honour!--why not say upon your honour, that\n",
      "it has nothing to do with any of them? Good Heavens!--What can be to be\n",
      "_broke_ to me, that does not relate to one of that family?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Upon my honour,” said he very seriously, “it does not. It is not in\n",
      "the smallest degree connected with any human being of the name of\n",
      "Knightley.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Emma's courage returned, and she walked on.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I was wrong,” he continued, “in talking of its being _broke_ to you.\n",
      "I should not have used the expression. In fact, it does not concern\n",
      "you--it concerns only myself,--that is, we hope.--Humph!--In short, my\n",
      "dear Emma, there is no occasion to be so uneasy about it. I don't\n",
      "say that it is not a disagreeable business--but things might be much\n",
      "worse.--If we walk fast, we shall soon be at Randalls.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Emma found that she must wait; and now it required little effort. She\n",
      "asked no more questions therefore, merely employed her own fancy, and\n",
      "that soon pointed out to her the probability of its being some money\n",
      "concern--something just come to light, of a disagreeable nature in the\n",
      "circumstances of the family,--something which the late event at Richmond\n",
      "had brought forward. Her fancy was very active. Half a dozen natural\n",
      "children, perhaps--and poor Frank cut off!--This, though very\n",
      "undesirable, would be no matter of agony to her. It inspired little more\n",
      "than an animating curiosity.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Who is that gentleman on horseback?” said she, as they\n",
      "proceeded--speaking more to assist Mr. Weston in keeping his secret,\n",
      "than with any other view.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I do not know.--One of the Otways.--Not Frank;--it is not Frank, I\n",
      "assure you. You will not see him. He is half way to Windsor by this\n",

      "\n",
      "“Oh! yes--did not you know?--Well, well, never mind.”\n",

      "For a moment he was silent; and then added, in a tone much more guarded\n",
      "and demure,\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, Frank came over this morning, just to ask us how we did.”\n",
      "\n",
      "They hurried on, and were speedily at Randalls.--“Well, my dear,” said\n",
      "he, as they entered the room--“I have brought her, and now I hope you\n",
      "will soon be better. I shall leave you together. There is no use in\n",
      "delay. I shall not be far off, if you want me.”--And Emma distinctly\n",
      "heard him add, in a lower tone, before he quitted the room,--“I have\n",
      "been as good as my word. She has not the least idea.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Weston was looking so ill, and had an air of so much perturbation,\n",
      "that Emma's uneasiness increased; and the moment they were alone, she\n",
      "eagerly said,\n",
      "\n",
      "“What is it my dear friend? Something of a very unpleasant nature, I\n",
      "find, has occurred;--do let me know directly what it is. I have been\n",
      "walking all this way in complete suspense. We both abhor suspense.\n",
      "Do not let mine continue longer. It will do you good to speak of your\n",
      "distress, whatever it may be.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Have you indeed no idea?” said Mrs. Weston in a trembling voice.\n",
      "“Cannot you, my dear Emma--cannot you form a guess as to what you are to\n",
      "hear?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“So far as that it relates to Mr. Frank Churchill, I do guess.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You are right. It does relate to him, and I will tell you directly;”\n",
      " (resuming her work, and seeming resolved against looking up.) “He has\n",
      "been here this very morning, on a most extraordinary errand. It is\n",
      "impossible to express our surprize. He came to speak to his father on a\n",
      "subject,--to announce an attachment--”\n",
      "\n",
      "She stopped to breathe. Emma thought first of herself, and then of\n",
      "Harriet.\n",
      "\n",
      "“More than an attachment, indeed,” resumed Mrs. Weston; “an\n",
      "engagement--a positive engagement.--What will you say, Emma--what will\n",
      "any body say, when it is known that Frank Churchill and Miss Fairfax are\n",
      "engaged;--nay, that they have been long engaged!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Emma even jumped with surprize;--and, horror-struck, exclaimed,\n",
      "\n",
      "“Jane Fairfax!--Good God! You are not serious? You do not mean it?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You may well be amazed,” returned Mrs. Weston, still averting her eyes,\n",
      "and talking on with eagerness, that Emma might have time to recover--\n",
      "“You may well be amazed. But it is even so. There has been a solemn\n",
      "engagement between them ever since October--formed at Weymouth, and\n",
      "kept a secret from every body. Not a creature knowing it but\n",
      "themselves--neither the Campbells, nor her family, nor his.--It is so\n",
      "wonderful, that though perfectly convinced of the fact, it is yet almost\n",
      "incredible to myself. I can hardly believe it.--I thought I knew him.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Emma scarcely heard what was said.--Her mind was divided between two\n",
      "ideas--her own former conversations with him about Miss Fairfax; and\n",
      "poor Harriet;--and for some time she could only exclaim, and require\n",
      "confirmation, repeated confirmation.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well,” said she at last, trying to recover herself; “this is a\n",
      "circumstance which I must think of at least half a day, before I can at\n",
      "all comprehend it. What!--engaged to her all the winter--before either\n",
      "of them came to Highbury?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Engaged since October,--secretly engaged.--It has hurt me, Emma, very\n",
      "much. It has hurt his father equally. _Some_ _part_ of his conduct we\n",
      "cannot excuse.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Emma pondered a moment, and then replied, “I will not pretend _not_ to\n",
      "understand you; and to give you all the relief in my power, be assured\n",
      "that no such effect has followed his attentions to me, as you are\n",
      "apprehensive of.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Weston looked up, afraid to believe; but Emma's countenance was as\n",
      "steady as her words.\n",
      "\n",
      "“That you may have less difficulty in believing this boast, of my\n",
      "present perfect indifference,” she continued, “I will farther tell you,\n",
      "that there was a period in the early part of our acquaintance, when I\n",
      "did like him, when I was very much disposed to be attached to him--nay,\n",
      "was attached--and how it came to cease, is perhaps the wonder.\n",
      "Fortunately, however, it did cease. I have really for some time past,\n",
      "for at least these three months, cared nothing about him. You may\n",
      "believe me, Mrs. Weston. This is the simple truth.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Weston kissed her with tears of joy; and when she could find\n",
      "utterance, assured her, that this protestation had done her more good\n",
      "than any thing else in the world could do.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Mr. Weston will be almost as much relieved as myself,” said she. “On\n",
      "this point we have been wretched. It was our darling wish that you\n",
      "might be attached to each other--and we were persuaded that it was so.--\n",
      "Imagine what we have been feeling on your account.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I have escaped; and that I should escape, may be a matter of grateful\n",
      "wonder to you and myself. But this does not acquit _him_, Mrs. Weston;\n",
      "and I must say, that I think him greatly to blame. What right had he\n",
      "to come among us with affection and faith engaged, and with manners\n",
      "so _very_ disengaged? What right had he to endeavour to please, as\n",
      "he certainly did--to distinguish any one young woman with persevering\n",
      "attention, as he certainly did--while he really belonged to\n",
      "another?--How could he tell what mischief he might be doing?--How could\n",
      "he tell that he might not be making me in love with him?--very wrong,\n",
      "very wrong indeed.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“From something that he said, my dear Emma, I rather imagine--”\n",
      "\n",
      "“And how could _she_ bear such behaviour! Composure with a witness!\n",
      "to look on, while repeated attentions were offering to another woman,\n",
      "before her face, and not resent it.--That is a degree of placidity,\n",
      "which I can neither comprehend nor respect.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“There were misunderstandings between them, Emma; he said so expressly.\n",
      "He had not time to enter into much explanation. He was here only a\n",
      "quarter of an hour, and in a state of agitation which did not allow\n",
      "the full use even of the time he could stay--but that there had been\n",
      "misunderstandings he decidedly said. The present crisis, indeed,\n",
      "seemed to be brought on by them; and those misunderstandings might very\n",
      "possibly arise from the impropriety of his conduct.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Impropriety! Oh! Mrs. Weston--it is too calm a censure. Much, much\n",
      "beyond impropriety!--It has sunk him, I cannot say how it has sunk him\n",
      "in my opinion. So unlike what a man should be!--None of that upright\n",
      "integrity, that strict adherence to truth and principle, that disdain of\n",
      "trick and littleness, which a man should display in every transaction of\n",
      "his life.”\n",

      "many, very many, good qualities; and--”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Good God!” cried Emma, not attending to her.--“Mrs. Smallridge, too!\n",
      "Jane actually on the point of going as governess! What could he mean by\n",
      "such horrible indelicacy? To suffer her to engage herself--to suffer her\n",
      "even to think of such a measure!”\n",
      "\n",

      "him. It was a private resolution of hers, not communicated to him--or at\n",
      "least not communicated in a way to carry conviction.--Till yesterday, I\n",
      "know he said he was in the dark as to her plans. They burst on him, I do\n",
      "not know how, but by some letter or message--and it was the discovery of\n",
      "what she was doing, of this very project of hers, which determined him\n",
      "to come forward at once, own it all to his uncle, throw himself on\n",
      "his kindness, and, in short, put an end to the miserable state of\n",
      "concealment that had been carrying on so long.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Emma began to listen better.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I am to hear from him soon,” continued Mrs. Weston. “He told me at\n",
      "parting, that he should soon write; and he spoke in a manner which\n",
      "seemed to promise me many particulars that could not be given now. Let\n",
      "us wait, therefore, for this letter. It may bring many extenuations. It\n",
      "may make many things intelligible and excusable which now are not to\n",
      "be understood. Don't let us be severe, don't let us be in a hurry to\n",
      "condemn him. Let us have patience. I must love him; and now that I am\n",
      "satisfied on one point, the one material point, I am sincerely anxious\n",
      "for its all turning out well, and ready to hope that it may. They must\n",
      "both have suffered a great deal under such a system of secresy and\n",
      "concealment.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“_His_ sufferings,” replied Emma dryly, “do not appear to have done him\n",
      "much harm. Well, and how did Mr. Churchill take it?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Most favourably for his nephew--gave his consent with scarcely a\n",
      "difficulty. Conceive what the events of a week have done in that family!\n",
      "While poor Mrs. Churchill lived, I suppose there could not have been a\n",
      "hope, a chance, a possibility;--but scarcely are her remains at rest in\n",
      "the family vault, than her husband is persuaded to act exactly opposite\n",
      "to what she would have required. What a blessing it is, when undue\n",
      "influence does not survive the grave!--He gave his consent with very\n",
      "little persuasion.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ah!” thought Emma, “he would have done as much for Harriet.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“This was settled last night, and Frank was off with the light this\n",
      "morning. He stopped at Highbury, at the Bates's, I fancy, some time--and\n",
      "then came on hither; but was in such a hurry to get back to his uncle,\n",
      "to whom he is just now more necessary than ever, that, as I tell you,\n",
      "he could stay with us but a quarter of an hour.--He was very much\n",
      "agitated--very much, indeed--to a degree that made him appear quite\n",
      "a different creature from any thing I had ever seen him before.--In\n",
      "addition to all the rest, there had been the shock of finding her so\n",
      "very unwell, which he had had no previous suspicion of--and there was\n",
      "every appearance of his having been feeling a great deal.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“And do you really believe the affair to have been carrying on with such\n",
      "perfect secresy?--The Campbells, the Dixons, did none of them know of\n",
      "the engagement?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Emma could not speak the name of Dixon without a little blush.\n",
      "\n",
      "“None; not one. He positively said that it had been known to no being in\n",
      "the world but their two selves.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well,” said Emma, “I suppose we shall gradually grow reconciled to the\n",
      "idea, and I wish them very happy. But I shall always think it a\n",
      "very abominable sort of proceeding. What has it been but a system of\n",
      "hypocrisy and deceit,--espionage, and treachery?--To come among us with\n",
      "professions of openness and simplicity; and such a league in secret\n",
      "to judge us all!--Here have we been, the whole winter and spring,\n",
      "completely duped, fancying ourselves all on an equal footing of truth\n",
      "and honour, with two people in the midst of us who may have been\n",
      "carrying round, comparing and sitting in judgment on sentiments and\n",
      "words that were never meant for both to hear.--They must take the\n",
      "consequence, if they have heard each other spoken of in a way not\n",
      "perfectly agreeable!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I am quite easy on that head,” replied Mrs. Weston. “I am very sure\n",
      "that I never said any thing of either to the other, which both might not\n",
      "have heard.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You are in luck.--Your only blunder was confined to my ear, when you\n",
      "imagined a certain friend of ours in love with the lady.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“True. But as I have always had a thoroughly good opinion of Miss\n",
      "Fairfax, I never could, under any blunder, have spoken ill of her; and\n",
      "as to speaking ill of him, there I must have been safe.”\n",
      "\n",
      "At this moment Mr. Weston appeared at a little distance from the window,\n",
      "evidently on the watch. His wife gave him a look which invited him\n",
      "in; and, while he was coming round, added, “Now, dearest Emma, let me\n",
      "intreat you to say and look every thing that may set his heart at ease,\n",
      "and incline him to be satisfied with the match. Let us make the best of\n",
      "it--and, indeed, almost every thing may be fairly said in her favour. It\n",
      "is not a connexion to gratify; but if Mr. Churchill does not feel that,\n",
      "why should we? and it may be a very fortunate circumstance for him, for\n",
      "Frank, I mean, that he should have attached himself to a girl of such\n",
      "steadiness of character and good judgment as I have always given her\n",
      "credit for--and still am disposed to give her credit for, in spite of\n",
      "this one great deviation from the strict rule of right. And how much may\n",
      "be said in her situation for even that error!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Much, indeed!” cried Emma feelingly. “If a woman can ever be\n",
      "excused for thinking only of herself, it is in a situation like Jane\n",
      "Fairfax's.--Of such, one may almost say, that 'the world is not their's,\n",
      "nor the world's law.'”\n",
      "\n",
      "She met Mr. Weston on his entrance, with a smiling countenance,\n",
      "exclaiming,\n",
      "\n",
      "“A very pretty trick you have been playing me, upon my word! This was a\n",
      "device, I suppose, to sport with my curiosity, and exercise my talent of\n",
      "guessing. But you really frightened me. I thought you had lost half\n",
      "your property, at least. And here, instead of its being a matter of\n",
      "condolence, it turns out to be one of congratulation.--I congratulate\n",
      "you, Mr. Weston, with all my heart, on the prospect of having one of the\n",
      "most lovely and accomplished young women in England for your daughter.”\n",
      "\n",
      "A glance or two between him and his wife, convinced him that all was as\n",
      "right as this speech proclaimed; and its happy effect on his spirits was\n",
      "immediate. His air and voice recovered their usual briskness: he shook\n",
      "her heartily and gratefully by the hand, and entered on the subject in\n",
      "a manner to prove, that he now only wanted time and persuasion to think\n",
      "the engagement no very bad thing. His companions suggested only what\n",
      "could palliate imprudence, or smooth objections; and by the time they\n",
      "had talked it all over together, and he had talked it all over again\n",
      "with Emma, in their walk back to Hartfield, he was become perfectly\n",

      "dupe of her misconceptions and flattery. Mr. Knightley had spoken\n",
      "prophetically, when he once said, “Emma, you have been no friend\n",
      "to Harriet Smith.”--She was afraid she had done her nothing but\n",
      "disservice.--It was true that she had not to charge herself, in this\n",
      "instance as in the former, with being the sole and original author of\n",
      "the mischief; with having suggested such feelings as might otherwise\n",
      "never have entered Harriet's imagination; for Harriet had acknowledged\n",
      "her admiration and preference of Frank Churchill before she had ever\n",
      "given her a hint on the subject; but she felt completely guilty\n",
      "of having encouraged what she might have repressed. She might have\n",
      "prevented the indulgence and increase of such sentiments. Her influence\n",
      "would have been enough. And now she was very conscious that she ought\n",
      "to have prevented them.--She felt that she had been risking her friend's\n",
      "happiness on most insufficient grounds. Common sense would have directed\n",
      "her to tell Harriet, that she must not allow herself to think of him,\n",
      "and that there were five hundred chances to one against his ever caring\n",
      "for her.--“But, with common sense,” she added, “I am afraid I have had\n",
      "little to do.”\n",
      "\n",
      "She was extremely angry with herself. If she could not have been angry\n",
      "with Frank Churchill too, it would have been dreadful.--As for Jane\n",
      "Fairfax, she might at least relieve her feelings from any present\n",
      "solicitude on her account. Harriet would be anxiety enough; she need\n",
      "no longer be unhappy about Jane, whose troubles and whose ill-health\n",
      "having, of course, the same origin, must be equally under cure.--Her\n",
      "days of insignificance and evil were over.--She would soon be well, and\n",
      "happy, and prosperous.--Emma could now imagine why her own attentions\n",
      "had been slighted. This discovery laid many smaller matters open. No\n",
      "doubt it had been from jealousy.--In Jane's eyes she had been a rival;\n",
      "and well might any thing she could offer of assistance or regard be\n",
      "repulsed. An airing in the Hartfield carriage would have been the rack,\n",
      "and arrowroot from the Hartfield storeroom must have been poison. She\n",
      "understood it all; and as far as her mind could disengage itself from\n",
      "the injustice and selfishness of angry feelings, she acknowledged that\n",
      "Jane Fairfax would have neither elevation nor happiness beyond her\n",
      "desert. But poor Harriet was such an engrossing charge! There was little\n",
      "sympathy to be spared for any body else. Emma was sadly fearful\n",
      "that this second disappointment would be more severe than the first.\n",
      "Considering the very superior claims of the object, it ought; and\n",
      "judging by its apparently stronger effect on Harriet's mind, producing\n",
      "reserve and self-command, it would.--She must communicate the painful\n",
      "truth, however, and as soon as possible. An injunction of secresy had\n",
      "been among Mr. Weston's parting words. “For the present, the whole\n",
      "affair was to be completely a secret. Mr. Churchill had made a point of\n",
      "it, as a token of respect to the wife he had so very recently lost;\n",
      "and every body admitted it to be no more than due decorum.”--Emma had\n",
      "promised; but still Harriet must be excepted. It was her superior duty.\n",
      "\n",
      "In spite of her vexation, she could not help feeling it almost\n",
      "ridiculous, that she should have the very same distressing and delicate\n",
      "office to perform by Harriet, which Mrs. Weston had just gone through by\n",
      "herself. The intelligence, which had been so anxiously announced to her,\n",
      "she was now to be anxiously announcing to another. Her heart beat quick\n",
      "on hearing Harriet's footstep and voice; so, she supposed, had poor Mrs.\n",
      "Weston felt when _she_ was approaching Randalls. Could the event of\n",
      "the disclosure bear an equal resemblance!--But of that, unfortunately,\n",
      "there could be no chance.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, Miss Woodhouse!” cried Harriet, coming eagerly into the room--“is\n",
      "not this the oddest news that ever was?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“What news do you mean?” replied Emma, unable to guess, by look or\n",
      "voice, whether Harriet could indeed have received any hint.\n",
      "\n",
      "“About Jane Fairfax. Did you ever hear any thing so strange? Oh!--you\n",
      "need not be afraid of owning it to me, for Mr. Weston has told me\n",
      "himself. I met him just now. He told me it was to be a great secret;\n",
      "and, therefore, I should not think of mentioning it to any body but you,\n",
      "but he said you knew it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“What did Mr. Weston tell you?”--said Emma, still perplexed.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh! he told me all about it; that Jane Fairfax and Mr. Frank Churchill\n",
      "are to be married, and that they have been privately engaged to one\n",
      "another this long while. How very odd!”\n",
      "\n",
      "It was, indeed, so odd; Harriet's behaviour was so extremely odd,\n",
      "that Emma did not know how to understand it. Her character appeared\n",
      "absolutely changed. She seemed to propose shewing no agitation, or\n",
      "disappointment, or peculiar concern in the discovery. Emma looked at\n",
      "her, quite unable to speak.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Had you any idea,” cried Harriet, “of his being in love with her?--You,\n",
      "perhaps, might.--You (blushing as she spoke) who can see into every\n",
      "body's heart; but nobody else--”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Upon my word,” said Emma, “I begin to doubt my having any such talent.\n",
      "Can you seriously ask me, Harriet, whether I imagined him attached\n",
      "to another woman at the very time that I was--tacitly, if not\n",
      "openly--encouraging you to give way to your own feelings?--I never\n",
      "had the slightest suspicion, till within the last hour, of Mr. Frank\n",
      "Churchill's having the least regard for Jane Fairfax. You may be very\n",
      "sure that if I had, I should have cautioned you accordingly.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Me!” cried Harriet, colouring, and astonished. “Why should you caution\n",
      "me?--You do not think I care about Mr. Frank Churchill.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I am delighted to hear you speak so stoutly on the subject,” replied\n",
      "Emma, smiling; “but you do not mean to deny that there was a time--and\n",
      "not very distant either--when you gave me reason to understand that you\n",
      "did care about him?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Him!--never, never. Dear Miss Woodhouse, how could you so mistake me?”\n",
      " turning away distressed.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Harriet!” cried Emma, after a moment's pause--“What do you mean?--Good\n",
      "Heaven! what do you mean?--Mistake you!--Am I to suppose then?--”\n",
      "\n",
      "She could not speak another word.--Her voice was lost; and she sat down,\n",
      "waiting in great terror till Harriet should answer.\n",
      "\n",
      "Harriet, who was standing at some distance, and with face turned from\n",
      "her, did not immediately say any thing; and when she did speak, it was\n",
      "in a voice nearly as agitated as Emma's.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I should not have thought it possible,” she began, “that you could have\n",
      "misunderstood me! I know we agreed never to name him--but considering\n",
      "how infinitely superior he is to every body else, I should not have\n",
      "thought it possible that I could be supposed to mean any other person.\n",
      "Mr. Frank Churchill, indeed! I do not know who would ever look at him in\n",
      "the company of the other. I hope I have a better taste than to think of\n",
      "Mr. Frank Churchill, who is like nobody by his side. And that you should\n",
      "have been so mistaken, is amazing!--I am sure, but for believing that\n",
      "you entirely approved and meant to encourage me in my attachment, I\n",
      "should have considered it at first too great a presumption almost,\n",
      "to dare to think of him. At first, if you had not told me that more\n",
      "wonderful things had happened; that there had been matches of greater\n",
      "disparity (those were your very words);--I should not have dared to\n",
      "give way to--I should not have thought it possible--But if _you_, who\n",
      "had been always acquainted with him--”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Harriet!” cried Emma, collecting herself resolutely--“Let us understand\n",
      "each other now, without the possibility of farther mistake. Are you\n",
      "speaking of--Mr. Knightley?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“To be sure I am. I never could have an idea of any body else--and so\n",
      "I thought you knew. When we talked about him, it was as clear as\n",
      "possible.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Not quite,” returned Emma, with forced calmness, “for all that you then\n",
      "said, appeared to me to relate to a different person. I could almost\n",
      "assert that you had _named_ Mr. Frank Churchill. I am sure the service\n",
      "Mr. Frank Churchill had rendered you, in protecting you from the\n",
      "gipsies, was spoken of.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh! Miss Woodhouse, how you do forget!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“My dear Harriet, I perfectly remember the substance of what I said on\n",
      "the occasion. I told you that I did not wonder at your attachment;\n",
      "that considering the service he had rendered you, it was extremely\n",
      "natural:--and you agreed to it, expressing yourself very warmly as to\n",
      "your sense of that service, and mentioning even what your sensations had\n",
      "been in seeing him come forward to your rescue.--The impression of it is\n",
      "strong on my memory.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, dear,” cried Harriet, “now I recollect what you mean; but I\n",
      "was thinking of something very different at the time. It was not the\n",
      "gipsies--it was not Mr. Frank Churchill that I meant. No! (with some\n",
      "elevation) I was thinking of a much more precious circumstance--of Mr.\n",
      "Knightley's coming and asking me to dance, when Mr. Elton would not\n",
      "stand up with me; and when there was no other partner in the room. That\n",
      "was the kind action; that was the noble benevolence and generosity; that\n",
      "was the service which made me begin to feel how superior he was to every\n",
      "other being upon earth.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Good God!” cried Emma, “this has been a most unfortunate--most\n",
      "deplorable mistake!--What is to be done?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You would not have encouraged me, then, if you had understood me? At\n",
      "least, however, I cannot be worse off than I should have been, if the\n",
      "other had been the person; and now--it _is_ possible--”\n",
      "\n",
      "She paused a few moments. Emma could not speak.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I do not wonder, Miss Woodhouse,” she resumed, “that you should feel a\n",
      "great difference between the two, as to me or as to any body. You must\n",
      "think one five hundred million times more above me than the other. But\n",
      "I hope, Miss Woodhouse, that supposing--that if--strange as it may\n",
      "appear--. But you know they were your own words, that _more_ wonderful\n",
      "things had happened, matches of _greater_ disparity had taken place than\n",
      "between Mr. Frank Churchill and me; and, therefore, it seems as if such\n",
      "a thing even as this, may have occurred before--and if I should be so\n",
      "fortunate, beyond expression, as to--if Mr. Knightley should really--if\n",
      "_he_ does not mind the disparity, I hope, dear Miss Woodhouse, you will\n",
      "not set yourself against it, and try to put difficulties in the way. But\n",
      "you are too good for that, I am sure.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Harriet was standing at one of the windows. Emma turned round to look at\n",
      "her in consternation, and hastily said,\n",
      "\n",
      "“Have you any idea of Mr. Knightley's returning your affection?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes,” replied Harriet modestly, but not fearfully--“I must say that I\n",
      "have.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Emma's eyes were instantly withdrawn; and she sat silently meditating,\n",
      "in a fixed attitude, for a few minutes. A few minutes were sufficient\n",
      "for making her acquainted with her own heart. A mind like hers,\n",
      "once opening to suspicion, made rapid progress. She touched--she\n",
      "admitted--she acknowledged the whole truth. Why was it so much worse\n",
      "that Harriet should be in love with Mr. Knightley, than with Frank\n",
      "Churchill? Why was the evil so dreadfully increased by Harriet's having\n",
      "some hope of a return? It darted through her, with the speed of an\n",
      "arrow, that Mr. Knightley must marry no one but herself!\n",
      "\n",
      "Her own conduct, as well as her own heart, was before her in the same\n",
      "few minutes. She saw it all with a clearness which had never blessed\n",
      "her before. How improperly had she been acting by Harriet! How\n",
      "inconsiderate, how indelicate, how irrational, how unfeeling had been\n",
      "her conduct! What blindness, what madness, had led her on! It struck her\n",
      "with dreadful force, and she was ready to give it every bad name in the\n",
      "world. Some portion of respect for herself, however, in spite of all\n",
      "these demerits--some concern for her own appearance, and a strong sense\n",
      "of justice by Harriet--(there would be no need of _compassion_ to the\n",
      "girl who believed herself loved by Mr. Knightley--but justice required\n",
      "that she should not be made unhappy by any coldness now,) gave Emma the\n",
      "resolution to sit and endure farther with calmness, with even apparent\n",
      "kindness.--For her own advantage indeed, it was fit that the utmost\n",
      "extent of Harriet's hopes should be enquired into; and Harriet had done\n",
      "nothing to forfeit the regard and interest which had been so voluntarily\n",
      "formed and maintained--or to deserve to be slighted by the person, whose\n",
      "counsels had never led her right.--Rousing from reflection, therefore,\n",
      "and subduing her emotion, she turned to Harriet again, and, in a more\n",
      "inviting accent, renewed the conversation; for as to the subject which\n",
      "had first introduced it, the wonderful story of Jane Fairfax, that was\n",
      "quite sunk and lost.--Neither of them thought but of Mr. Knightley and\n",
      "themselves.\n",
      "\n",
      "Harriet, who had been standing in no unhappy reverie, was yet very glad\n",
      "to be called from it, by the now encouraging manner of such a judge, and\n",
      "such a friend as Miss Woodhouse, and only wanted invitation, to give\n",
      "the history of her hopes with great, though trembling delight.--Emma's\n",
      "tremblings as she asked, and as she listened, were better concealed than\n",
      "Harriet's, but they were not less. Her voice was not unsteady; but her\n",
      "mind was in all the perturbation that such a development of self, such\n",
      "a burst of threatening evil, such a confusion of sudden and perplexing\n",
      "emotions, must create.--She listened with much inward suffering, but\n",
      "with great outward patience, to Harriet's detail.--Methodical, or well\n",
      "arranged, or very well delivered, it could not be expected to be; but it\n",
      "contained, when separated from all the feebleness and tautology of\n",
      "the narration, a substance to sink her spirit--especially with the\n",
      "corroborating circumstances, which her own memory brought in favour of\n",
      "Mr. Knightley's most improved opinion of Harriet.\n",
      "\n",
      "Harriet had been conscious of a difference in his behaviour ever since\n",
      "those two decisive dances.--Emma knew that he had, on that occasion,\n",
      "found her much superior to his expectation. From that evening, or at\n",
      "least from the time of Miss Woodhouse's encouraging her to think of him,\n",
      "Harriet had begun to be sensible of his talking to her much more than he\n",
      "had been used to do, and of his having indeed quite a different manner\n",
      "towards her; a manner of kindness and sweetness!--Latterly she had been\n",
      "more and more aware of it. When they had been all walking together,\n",
      "he had so often come and walked by her, and talked so very\n",
      "delightfully!--He seemed to want to be acquainted with her. Emma knew it\n",
      "to have been very much the case. She had often observed the change, to\n",
      "almost the same extent.--Harriet repeated expressions of approbation\n",
      "and praise from him--and Emma felt them to be in the closest agreement\n",
      "with what she had known of his opinion of Harriet. He praised her for\n",
      "being without art or affectation, for having simple, honest, generous,\n",
      "feelings.--She knew that he saw such recommendations in Harriet; he\n",
      "had dwelt on them to her more than once.--Much that lived in Harriet's\n",
      "memory, many little particulars of the notice she had received from\n",
      "him, a look, a speech, a removal from one chair to another, a compliment\n",
      "implied, a preference inferred, had been unnoticed, because unsuspected,\n",
      "by Emma. Circumstances that might swell to half an hour's relation,\n",
      "and contained multiplied proofs to her who had seen them, had passed\n",
      "undiscerned by her who now heard them; but the two latest occurrences to\n",
      "be mentioned, the two of strongest promise to Harriet, were not without\n",
      "some degree of witness from Emma herself.--The first, was his walking\n",
      "with her apart from the others, in the lime-walk at Donwell, where they\n",
      "had been walking some time before Emma came, and he had taken pains (as\n",
      "she was convinced) to draw her from the rest to himself--and at first,\n",
      "he had talked to her in a more particular way than he had ever done\n",
      "before, in a very particular way indeed!--(Harriet could not recall\n",
      "it without a blush.) He seemed to be almost asking her, whether her\n",
      "affections were engaged.--But as soon as she (Miss Woodhouse) appeared\n",
      "likely to join them, he changed the subject, and began talking about\n",
      "farming:--The second, was his having sat talking with her nearly half\n",
      "an hour before Emma came back from her visit, the very last morning of\n",
      "his being at Hartfield--though, when he first came in, he had said that\n",
      "he could not stay five minutes--and his having told her, during their\n",
      "conversation, that though he must go to London, it was very much against\n",
      "his inclination that he left home at all, which was much more (as\n",
      "Emma felt) than he had acknowledged to _her_. The superior degree of\n",
      "confidence towards Harriet, which this one article marked, gave her\n",
      "severe pain.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the subject of the first of the two circumstances, she did, after a\n",
      "little reflection, venture the following question. “Might he not?--Is\n",
      "not it possible, that when enquiring, as you thought, into the state of\n",
      "your affections, he might be alluding to Mr. Martin--he might have\n",
      "Mr. Martin's interest in view? But Harriet rejected the suspicion with\n",
      "spirit.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Mr. Martin! No indeed!--There was not a hint of Mr. Martin. I hope I\n",
      "know better now, than to care for Mr. Martin, or to be suspected of it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "When Harriet had closed her evidence, she appealed to her dear Miss\n",
      "Woodhouse, to say whether she had not good ground for hope.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I never should have presumed to think of it at first,” said she, “but\n",
      "for you. You told me to observe him carefully, and let his behaviour\n",
      "be the rule of mine--and so I have. But now I seem to feel that I may\n",
      "deserve him; and that if he does chuse me, it will not be any thing so\n",
      "very wonderful.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The bitter feelings occasioned by this speech, the many bitter feelings,\n",
      "made the utmost exertion necessary on Emma's side, to enable her to say\n",
      "on reply,\n",
      "\n",
      "“Harriet, I will only venture to declare, that Mr. Knightley is the last\n",
      "man in the world, who would intentionally give any woman the idea of his\n",
      "feeling for her more than he really does.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Harriet seemed ready to worship her friend for a sentence so\n",
      "satisfactory; and Emma was only saved from raptures and fondness, which\n",
      "at that moment would have been dreadful penance, by the sound of her\n",
      "father's footsteps. He was coming through the hall. Harriet was too\n",
      "much agitated to encounter him. “She could not compose herself--\n",
      "Mr. Woodhouse would be alarmed--she had better go;”--with most ready\n",
      "encouragement from her friend, therefore, she passed off through another\n",
      "door--and the moment she was gone, this was the spontaneous burst of\n",
      "Emma's feelings: “Oh God! that I had never seen her!”\n",
      "\n",
      "The rest of the day, the following night, were hardly enough for her\n",
      "thoughts.--She was bewildered amidst the confusion of all that had\n",
      "rushed on her within the last few hours. Every moment had brought a\n",
      "fresh surprize; and every surprize must be matter of humiliation to\n",
      "her.--How to understand it all! How to understand the deceptions she had\n",
      "been thus practising on herself, and living under!--The blunders, the\n",
      "blindness of her own head and heart!--she sat still, she walked about,\n",
      "she tried her own room, she tried the shrubbery--in every place, every\n",
      "posture, she perceived that she had acted most weakly; that she had\n",
      "been imposed on by others in a most mortifying degree; that she had\n",
      "been imposing on herself in a degree yet more mortifying; that she\n",
      "was wretched, and should probably find this day but the beginning of\n",
      "wretchedness.\n",
      "\n",
      "To understand, thoroughly understand her own heart, was the first\n",
      "endeavour. To that point went every leisure moment which her father's\n",
      "claims on her allowed, and every moment of involuntary absence of mind.\n",
      "\n",
      "How long had Mr. Knightley been so dear to her, as every feeling\n",
      "declared him now to be? When had his influence, such influence begun?--\n",
      "When had he succeeded to that place in her affection, which Frank\n",
      "Churchill had once, for a short period, occupied?--She looked back;\n",

      "Till now that she was threatened with its loss, Emma had never known\n",
      "how much of her happiness depended on being _first_ with Mr. Knightley,\n",
      "first in interest and affection.--Satisfied that it was so, and feeling\n",
      "it her due, she had enjoyed it without reflection; and only in the\n",
      "dread of being supplanted, found how inexpressibly important it had\n",
      "been.--Long, very long, she felt she had been first; for, having no\n",
      "female connexions of his own, there had been only Isabella whose claims\n",
      "could be compared with hers, and she had always known exactly how far\n",
      "he loved and esteemed Isabella. She had herself been first with him for\n",
      "many years past. She had not deserved it; she had often been negligent\n",
      "or perverse, slighting his advice, or even wilfully opposing him,\n",
      "insensible of half his merits, and quarrelling with him because he would\n",
      "not acknowledge her false and insolent estimate of her own--but still,\n",
      "from family attachment and habit, and thorough excellence of mind, he\n",
      "had loved her, and watched over her from a girl, with an endeavour to\n",
      "improve her, and an anxiety for her doing right, which no other creature\n",
      "had at all shared. In spite of all her faults, she knew she was dear\n",
      "to him; might she not say, very dear?--When the suggestions of hope,\n",
      "however, which must follow here, presented themselves, she could not\n",
      "presume to indulge them. Harriet Smith might think herself not unworthy\n",
      "of being peculiarly, exclusively, passionately loved by Mr. Knightley.\n",
      "_She_ could not. She could not flatter herself with any idea of\n",
      "blindness in his attachment to _her_. She had received a very recent\n",
      "proof of its impartiality.--How shocked had he been by her behaviour to\n",
      "Miss Bates! How directly, how strongly had he expressed himself to her\n",
      "on the subject!--Not too strongly for the offence--but far, far too\n",
      "strongly to issue from any feeling softer than upright justice and\n",
      "clear-sighted goodwill.--She had no hope, nothing to deserve the name\n",
      "of hope, that he could have that sort of affection for herself which was\n",
      "now in question; but there was a hope (at times a slight one, at\n",
      "times much stronger,) that Harriet might have deceived herself, and be\n",
      "overrating his regard for _her_.--Wish it she must, for his sake--be the\n",

      "Could she be secure of that, indeed, of his never marrying at all, she\n",
      "believed she should be perfectly satisfied.--Let him but continue the\n",
      "same Mr. Knightley to her and her father, the same Mr. Knightley to\n",
      "all the world; let Donwell and Hartfield lose none of their precious\n",
      "intercourse of friendship and confidence, and her peace would be\n",
      "fully secured.--Marriage, in fact, would not do for her. It would be\n",
      "incompatible with what she owed to her father, and with what she felt\n",
      "for him. Nothing should separate her from her father. She would not\n",
      "marry, even if she were asked by Mr. Knightley.\n",

      "It must be her ardent wish that Harriet might be disappointed; and she\n",
      "hoped, that when able to see them together again, she might at least\n",
      "be able to ascertain what the chances for it were.--She should see them\n",
      "henceforward with the closest observance; and wretchedly as she had\n",
      "hitherto misunderstood even those she was watching, she did not know how\n",
      "to admit that she could be blinded here.--He was expected back every\n",
      "day. The power of observation would be soon given--frightfully soon it\n",
      "appeared when her thoughts were in one course. In the meanwhile, she\n",
      "resolved against seeing Harriet.--It would do neither of them good,\n",
      "it would do the subject no good, to be talking of it farther.--She was\n",
      "resolved not to be convinced, as long as she could doubt, and yet had\n",
      "no authority for opposing Harriet's confidence. To talk would be only to\n",
      "irritate.--She wrote to her, therefore, kindly, but decisively, to beg\n",
      "that she would not, at present, come to Hartfield; acknowledging it to\n",
      "be her conviction, that all farther confidential discussion of _one_\n",
      "topic had better be avoided; and hoping, that if a few days were allowed\n",
      "to pass before they met again, except in the company of others--she\n",
      "objected only to a tete-a-tete--they might be able to act as if they\n",

      "thoughts a little from the one subject which had engrossed them,\n",
      "sleeping or waking, the last twenty-four hours--Mrs. Weston, who had\n",
      "been calling on her daughter-in-law elect, and took Hartfield in her\n",

      "relate all the particulars of so interesting an interview.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Weston had accompanied her to Mrs. Bates's, and gone through his\n",
      "share of this essential attention most handsomely; but she having then\n",
      "induced Miss Fairfax to join her in an airing, was now returned with\n",
      "much more to say, and much more to say with satisfaction, than a quarter\n",
      "of an hour spent in Mrs. Bates's parlour, with all the encumbrance of\n",
      "awkward feelings, could have afforded.\n",
      "\n",
      "A little curiosity Emma had; and she made the most of it while her\n",
      "friend related. Mrs. Weston had set off to pay the visit in a good deal\n",
      "of agitation herself; and in the first place had wished not to go at all\n",
      "at present, to be allowed merely to write to Miss Fairfax instead, and\n",
      "to defer this ceremonious call till a little time had passed, and Mr.\n",
      "Churchill could be reconciled to the engagement's becoming known; as,\n",
      "considering every thing, she thought such a visit could not be paid\n",
      "without leading to reports:--but Mr. Weston had thought differently; he\n",
      "was extremely anxious to shew his approbation to Miss Fairfax and her\n",
      "family, and did not conceive that any suspicion could be excited by it;\n",
      "or if it were, that it would be of any consequence; for “such things,”\n",
      " he observed, “always got about.” Emma smiled, and felt that Mr. Weston\n",
      "had very good reason for saying so. They had gone, in short--and very\n",
      "great had been the evident distress and confusion of the lady. She had\n",
      "hardly been able to speak a word, and every look and action had shewn\n",
      "how deeply she was suffering from consciousness. The quiet, heart-felt\n",
      "satisfaction of the old lady, and the rapturous delight of her\n",
      "daughter--who proved even too joyous to talk as usual, had been a\n",
      "gratifying, yet almost an affecting, scene. They were both so truly\n",
      "respectable in their happiness, so disinterested in every sensation;\n",
      "thought so much of Jane; so much of every body, and so little of\n",
      "themselves, that every kindly feeling was at work for them. Miss\n",
      "Fairfax's recent illness had offered a fair plea for Mrs. Weston to\n",
      "invite her to an airing; she had drawn back and declined at first, but,\n",
      "on being pressed had yielded; and, in the course of their drive,\n",
      "Mrs. Weston had, by gentle encouragement, overcome so much of her\n",
      "embarrassment, as to bring her to converse on the important subject.\n",
      "Apologies for her seemingly ungracious silence in their first reception,\n",
      "and the warmest expressions of the gratitude she was always feeling\n",
      "towards herself and Mr. Weston, must necessarily open the cause; but\n",
      "when these effusions were put by, they had talked a good deal of the\n",
      "present and of the future state of the engagement. Mrs. Weston was\n",
      "convinced that such conversation must be the greatest relief to her\n",
      "companion, pent up within her own mind as every thing had so long been,\n",
      "and was very much pleased with all that she had said on the subject.\n",
      "\n",
      "“On the misery of what she had suffered, during the concealment of so\n",
      "many months,” continued Mrs. Weston, “she was energetic. This was one\n",
      "of her expressions. 'I will not say, that since I entered into the\n",
      "engagement I have not had some happy moments; but I can say, that I have\n",
      "never known the blessing of one tranquil hour:'--and the quivering lip,\n",
      "Emma, which uttered it, was an attestation that I felt at my heart.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Poor girl!” said Emma. “She thinks herself wrong, then, for having\n",
      "consented to a private engagement?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Wrong! No one, I believe, can blame her more than she is disposed\n",
      "to blame herself. 'The consequence,' said she, 'has been a state of\n",
      "perpetual suffering to me; and so it ought. But after all the punishment\n",
      "that misconduct can bring, it is still not less misconduct. Pain is no\n",
      "expiation. I never can be blameless. I have been acting contrary to all\n",
      "my sense of right; and the fortunate turn that every thing has taken,\n",
      "and the kindness I am now receiving, is what my conscience tells me\n",
      "ought not to be.' 'Do not imagine, madam,' she continued, 'that I was\n",
      "taught wrong. Do not let any reflection fall on the principles or the\n",
      "care of the friends who brought me up. The error has been all my own;\n",
      "and I do assure you that, with all the excuse that present circumstances\n",
      "may appear to give, I shall yet dread making the story known to Colonel\n",
      "Campbell.'”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Poor girl!” said Emma again. “She loves him then excessively, I\n",
      "suppose. It must have been from attachment only, that she could be\n",
      "led to form the engagement. Her affection must have overpowered her\n",
      "judgment.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, I have no doubt of her being extremely attached to him.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I am afraid,” returned Emma, sighing, “that I must often have\n",
      "contributed to make her unhappy.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“On your side, my love, it was very innocently done. But she\n",
      "probably had something of that in her thoughts, when alluding to the\n",
      "misunderstandings which he had given us hints of before. One natural\n",
      "consequence of the evil she had involved herself in,” she said, “was\n",
      "that of making her _unreasonable_. The consciousness of having done\n",
      "amiss, had exposed her to a thousand inquietudes, and made her captious\n",
      "and irritable to a degree that must have been--that had been--hard for\n",
      "him to bear. 'I did not make the allowances,' said she, 'which I ought\n",
      "to have done, for his temper and spirits--his delightful spirits, and\n",
      "that gaiety, that playfulness of disposition, which, under any other\n",
      "circumstances, would, I am sure, have been as constantly bewitching to\n",
      "me, as they were at first.' She then began to speak of you, and of the\n",
      "great kindness you had shewn her during her illness; and with a blush\n",
      "which shewed me how it was all connected, desired me, whenever I had\n",
      "an opportunity, to thank you--I could not thank you too much--for every\n",
      "wish and every endeavour to do her good. She was sensible that you had\n",
      "never received any proper acknowledgment from herself.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“If I did not know her to be happy now,” said Emma, seriously, “which,\n",
      "in spite of every little drawback from her scrupulous conscience, she\n",
      "must be, I could not bear these thanks;--for, oh! Mrs. Weston, if there\n",
      "were an account drawn up of the evil and the good I have done Miss\n",
      "Fairfax!--Well (checking herself, and trying to be more lively), this\n",
      "is all to be forgotten. You are very kind to bring me these interesting\n",
      "particulars. They shew her to the greatest advantage. I am sure she is\n",
      "very good--I hope she will be very happy. It is fit that the fortune\n",
      "should be on his side, for I think the merit will be all on hers.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Such a conclusion could not pass unanswered by Mrs. Weston. She thought\n",
      "well of Frank in almost every respect; and, what was more, she loved him\n",
      "very much, and her defence was, therefore, earnest. She talked with a\n",
      "great deal of reason, and at least equal affection--but she had too much\n",
      "to urge for Emma's attention; it was soon gone to Brunswick Square or\n",
      "to Donwell; she forgot to attempt to listen; and when Mrs. Weston ended\n",
      "with, “We have not yet had the letter we are so anxious for, you know,\n",
      "but I hope it will soon come,” she was obliged to pause before she\n",
      "answered, and at last obliged to answer at random, before she could at\n",
      "all recollect what letter it was which they were so anxious for.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Are you well, my Emma?” was Mrs. Weston's parting question.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh! perfectly. I am always well, you know. Be sure to give me\n",
      "intelligence of the letter as soon as possible.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Weston's communications furnished Emma with more food for\n",
      "unpleasant reflection, by increasing her esteem and compassion, and her\n",
      "sense of past injustice towards Miss Fairfax. She bitterly regretted\n",
      "not having sought a closer acquaintance with her, and blushed for the\n",
      "envious feelings which had certainly been, in some measure, the cause.\n",
      "Had she followed Mr. Knightley's known wishes, in paying that attention\n",
      "to Miss Fairfax, which was every way her due; had she tried to know her\n",
      "better; had she done her part towards intimacy; had she endeavoured\n",
      "to find a friend there instead of in Harriet Smith; she must, in all\n",
      "probability, have been spared from every pain which pressed on her\n",
      "now.--Birth, abilities, and education, had been equally marking one as\n",
      "an associate for her, to be received with gratitude; and the other--what\n",
      "was she?--Supposing even that they had never become intimate friends;\n",
      "that she had never been admitted into Miss Fairfax's confidence on this\n",
      "important matter--which was most probable--still, in knowing her as\n",
      "she ought, and as she might, she must have been preserved from the\n",
      "abominable suspicions of an improper attachment to Mr. Dixon, which she\n",
      "had not only so foolishly fashioned and harboured herself, but had so\n",
      "unpardonably imparted; an idea which she greatly feared had been made a\n",
      "subject of material distress to the delicacy of Jane's feelings, by the\n",
      "levity or carelessness of Frank Churchill's. Of all the sources of evil\n",
      "surrounding the former, since her coming to Highbury, she was persuaded\n",
      "that she must herself have been the worst. She must have been a\n",
      "perpetual enemy. They never could have been all three together, without\n",
      "her having stabbed Jane Fairfax's peace in a thousand instances; and on\n",
      "Box Hill, perhaps, it had been the agony of a mind that would bear no\n",
      "more.\n",
      "\n",
      "The evening of this day was very long, and melancholy, at Hartfield.\n",
      "The weather added what it could of gloom. A cold stormy rain set in, and\n",
      "nothing of July appeared but in the trees and shrubs, which the wind was\n",
      "despoiling, and the length of the day, which only made such cruel sights\n",
      "the longer visible.\n",
      "\n",
      "The weather affected Mr. Woodhouse, and he could only be kept tolerably\n",
      "comfortable by almost ceaseless attention on his daughter's side, and by\n",
      "exertions which had never cost her half so much before. It reminded\n",
      "her of their first forlorn tete-a-tete, on the evening of Mrs. Weston's\n",
      "wedding-day; but Mr. Knightley had walked in then, soon after tea,\n",
      "and dissipated every melancholy fancy. Alas! such delightful proofs of\n",
      "Hartfield's attraction, as those sort of visits conveyed, might shortly\n",
      "be over. The picture which she had then drawn of the privations of the\n",
      "approaching winter, had proved erroneous; no friends had deserted them,\n",
      "no pleasures had been lost.--But her present forebodings she feared\n",
      "would experience no similar contradiction. The prospect before her now,\n",
      "was threatening to a degree that could not be entirely dispelled--that\n",
      "might not be even partially brightened. If all took place that\n",
      "might take place among the circle of her friends, Hartfield must be\n",
      "comparatively deserted; and she left to cheer her father with the\n",
      "spirits only of ruined happiness.\n",
      "\n",
      "The child to be born at Randalls must be a tie there even dearer than\n",
      "herself; and Mrs. Weston's heart and time would be occupied by it.\n",
      "They should lose her; and, probably, in great measure, her husband\n",
      "also.--Frank Churchill would return among them no more; and Miss\n",
      "Fairfax, it was reasonable to suppose, would soon cease to belong to\n",
      "Highbury. They would be married, and settled either at or near Enscombe.\n",
      "All that were good would be withdrawn; and if to these losses, the\n",
      "loss of Donwell were to be added, what would remain of cheerful or\n",
      "of rational society within their reach? Mr. Knightley to be no longer\n",
      "coming there for his evening comfort!--No longer walking in at all\n",
      "hours, as if ever willing to change his own home for their's!--How was\n",
      "it to be endured? And if he were to be lost to them for Harriet's sake;\n",
      "if he were to be thought of hereafter, as finding in Harriet's society\n",
      "all that he wanted; if Harriet were to be the chosen, the first,\n",
      "the dearest, the friend, the wife to whom he looked for all the best\n",
      "blessings of existence; what could be increasing Emma's wretchedness but\n",
      "the reflection never far distant from her mind, that it had been all her\n",
      "own work?\n",
      "\n",
      "When it came to such a pitch as this, she was not able to refrain from\n",
      "a start, or a heavy sigh, or even from walking about the room for a\n",
      "few seconds--and the only source whence any thing like consolation\n",
      "or composure could be drawn, was in the resolution of her own better\n",
      "conduct, and the hope that, however inferior in spirit and gaiety might\n",
      "be the following and every future winter of her life to the past, it\n",

      "The weather continued much the same all the following morning; and\n",
      "the same loneliness, and the same melancholy, seemed to reign at\n",
      "Hartfield--but in the afternoon it cleared; the wind changed into a\n",
      "softer quarter; the clouds were carried off; the sun appeared; it was\n",
      "summer again. With all the eagerness which such a transition gives, Emma\n",
      "resolved to be out of doors as soon as possible. Never had the exquisite\n",
      "sight, smell, sensation of nature, tranquil, warm, and brilliant after\n",
      "a storm, been more attractive to her. She longed for the serenity they\n",
      "might gradually introduce; and on Mr. Perry's coming in soon after\n",
      "dinner, with a disengaged hour to give her father, she lost no time\n",
      "in hurrying into the shrubbery.--There, with spirits freshened, and\n",
      "thoughts a little relieved, she had taken a few turns, when she saw Mr.\n",
      "Knightley passing through the garden door, and coming towards her.--It\n",
      "was the first intimation of his being returned from London. She had\n",
      "been thinking of him the moment before, as unquestionably sixteen miles\n",
      "distant.--There was time only for the quickest arrangement of mind. She\n",
      "must be collected and calm. In half a minute they were together. The\n",
      "“How d'ye do's” were quiet and constrained on each side. She asked after\n",
      "their mutual friends; they were all well.--When had he left them?--Only\n",
      "that morning. He must have had a wet ride.--Yes.--He meant to walk with\n",
      "her, she found. “He had just looked into the dining-room, and as he was\n",
      "not wanted there, preferred being out of doors.”--She thought he neither\n",
      "looked nor spoke cheerfully; and the first possible cause for it,\n",
      "suggested by her fears, was, that he had perhaps been communicating his\n",
      "plans to his brother, and was pained by the manner in which they had\n",
      "been received.\n",
      "\n",
      "They walked together. He was silent. She thought he was often looking\n",
      "at her, and trying for a fuller view of her face than it suited her to\n",
      "give. And this belief produced another dread. Perhaps he wanted to\n",
      "speak to her, of his attachment to Harriet; he might be watching for\n",
      "encouragement to begin.--She did not, could not, feel equal to lead the\n",
      "way to any such subject. He must do it all himself. Yet she could\n",
      "not bear this silence. With him it was most unnatural. She\n",
      "considered--resolved--and, trying to smile, began--\n",
      "\n",
      "“You have some news to hear, now you are come back, that will rather\n",
      "surprize you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Have I?” said he quietly, and looking at her; “of what nature?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh! the best nature in the world--a wedding.”\n",
      "\n",
      "After waiting a moment, as if to be sure she intended to say no more, he\n",
      "replied,\n",
      "\n",
      "“If you mean Miss Fairfax and Frank Churchill, I have heard that\n",
      "already.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“How is it possible?” cried Emma, turning her glowing cheeks towards\n",
      "him; for, while she spoke, it occurred to her that he might have called\n",
      "at Mrs. Goddard's in his way.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I had a few lines on parish business from Mr. Weston this morning, and\n",
      "at the end of them he gave me a brief account of what had happened.”\n",

      "\n",
      "“_You_ probably have been less surprized than any of us, for you have\n",
      "had your suspicions.--I have not forgotten that you once tried to give\n",
      "me a caution.--I wish I had attended to it--but--(with a sinking voice\n",
      "and a heavy sigh) I seem to have been doomed to blindness.”\n",
      "\n",
      "For a moment or two nothing was said, and she was unsuspicious of having\n",
      "excited any particular interest, till she found her arm drawn within\n",
      "his, and pressed against his heart, and heard him thus saying, in a tone\n",
      "of great sensibility, speaking low,\n",
      "\n",
      "“Time, my dearest Emma, time will heal the wound.--Your own excellent\n",
      "sense--your exertions for your father's sake--I know you will not allow\n",
      "yourself--.” Her arm was pressed again, as he added, in a more\n",
      "broken and subdued accent, “The feelings of the warmest\n",
      "friendship--Indignation--Abominable scoundrel!”--And in a louder,\n",
      "steadier tone, he concluded with, “He will soon be gone. They will soon\n",
      "be in Yorkshire. I am sorry for _her_. She deserves a better fate.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Emma understood him; and as soon as she could recover from the flutter\n",
      "of pleasure, excited by such tender consideration, replied,\n",
      "\n",
      "“You are very kind--but you are mistaken--and I must set you right.--\n",
      "I am not in want of that sort of compassion. My blindness to what was\n",
      "going on, led me to act by them in a way that I must always be ashamed\n",
      "of, and I was very foolishly tempted to say and do many things which may\n",
      "well lay me open to unpleasant conjectures, but I have no other reason\n",
      "to regret that I was not in the secret earlier.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Emma!” cried he, looking eagerly at her, “are you, indeed?”--but\n",
      "checking himself--“No, no, I understand you--forgive me--I am pleased\n",
      "that you can say even so much.--He is no object of regret, indeed! and\n",
      "it will not be very long, I hope, before that becomes the acknowledgment\n",
      "of more than your reason.--Fortunate that your affections were not\n",
      "farther entangled!--I could never, I confess, from your manners, assure\n",
      "myself as to the degree of what you felt--I could only be certain that\n",
      "there was a preference--and a preference which I never believed him to\n",
      "deserve.--He is a disgrace to the name of man.--And is he to be rewarded\n",
      "with that sweet young woman?--Jane, Jane, you will be a miserable\n",
      "creature.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Mr. Knightley,” said Emma, trying to be lively, but really confused--“I\n",
      "am in a very extraordinary situation. I cannot let you continue in your\n",
      "error; and yet, perhaps, since my manners gave such an impression, I\n",
      "have as much reason to be ashamed of confessing that I never have been\n",
      "at all attached to the person we are speaking of, as it might be natural\n",
      "for a woman to feel in confessing exactly the reverse.--But I never\n",
      "have.”\n",

      "He listened in perfect silence. She wished him to speak, but he would\n",
      "not. She supposed she must say more before she were entitled to his\n",
      "clemency; but it was a hard case to be obliged still to lower herself in\n",
      "his opinion. She went on, however.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I have very little to say for my own conduct.--I was tempted by his\n",
      "attentions, and allowed myself to appear pleased.--An old story,\n",
      "probably--a common case--and no more than has happened to hundreds of my\n",
      "sex before; and yet it may not be the more excusable in one who sets up\n",
      "as I do for Understanding. Many circumstances assisted the temptation.\n",
      "He was the son of Mr. Weston--he was continually here--I always found\n",
      "him very pleasant--and, in short, for (with a sigh) let me swell out the\n",
      "causes ever so ingeniously, they all centre in this at last--my vanity\n",
      "was flattered, and I allowed his attentions. Latterly, however--for some\n",
      "time, indeed--I have had no idea of their meaning any thing.--I thought\n",
      "them a habit, a trick, nothing that called for seriousness on my side.\n",
      "He has imposed on me, but he has not injured me. I have never been\n",
      "attached to him. And now I can tolerably comprehend his behaviour. He\n",
      "never wished to attach me. It was merely a blind to conceal his real\n",
      "situation with another.--It was his object to blind all about him; and\n",
      "no one, I am sure, could be more effectually blinded than myself--except\n",
      "that I was _not_ blinded--that it was my good fortune--that, in short, I\n",
      "was somehow or other safe from him.”\n",
      "\n",
      "She had hoped for an answer here--for a few words to say that her\n",
      "conduct was at least intelligible; but he was silent; and, as far as she\n",
      "could judge, deep in thought. At last, and tolerably in his usual tone,\n",
      "he said,\n",
      "\n",
      "“I have never had a high opinion of Frank Churchill.--I can suppose,\n",
      "however, that I may have underrated him. My acquaintance with him has\n",
      "been but trifling.--And even if I have not underrated him hitherto, he\n",
      "may yet turn out well.--With such a woman he has a chance.--I have no\n",
      "motive for wishing him ill--and for her sake, whose happiness will be\n",
      "involved in his good character and conduct, I shall certainly wish him\n",
      "well.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I have no doubt of their being happy together,” said Emma; “I believe\n",
      "them to be very mutually and very sincerely attached.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“He is a most fortunate man!” returned Mr. Knightley, with energy. “So\n",
      "early in life--at three-and-twenty--a period when, if a man chuses a\n",
      "wife, he generally chuses ill. At three-and-twenty to have drawn such\n",
      "a prize! What years of felicity that man, in all human calculation,\n",
      "has before him!--Assured of the love of such a woman--the disinterested\n",
      "love, for Jane Fairfax's character vouches for her disinterestedness;\n",
      "every thing in his favour,--equality of situation--I mean, as far as\n",
      "regards society, and all the habits and manners that are important;\n",
      "equality in every point but one--and that one, since the purity of her\n",
      "heart is not to be doubted, such as must increase his felicity, for it\n",
      "will be his to bestow the only advantages she wants.--A man would always\n",
      "wish to give a woman a better home than the one he takes her from;\n",
      "and he who can do it, where there is no doubt of _her_ regard, must,\n",
      "I think, be the happiest of mortals.--Frank Churchill is, indeed, the\n",
      "favourite of fortune. Every thing turns out for his good.--He meets\n",
      "with a young woman at a watering-place, gains her affection, cannot even\n",
      "weary her by negligent treatment--and had he and all his family sought\n",
      "round the world for a perfect wife for him, they could not have found\n",
      "her superior.--His aunt is in the way.--His aunt dies.--He has only to\n",
      "speak.--His friends are eager to promote his happiness.--He had used\n",
      "every body ill--and they are all delighted to forgive him.--He is a\n",
      "fortunate man indeed!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You speak as if you envied him.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“And I do envy him, Emma. In one respect he is the object of my envy.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Emma could say no more. They seemed to be within half a sentence\n",
      "of Harriet, and her immediate feeling was to avert the subject, if\n",
      "possible. She made her plan; she would speak of something totally\n",
      "different--the children in Brunswick Square; and she only waited for\n",
      "breath to begin, when Mr. Knightley startled her, by saying,\n",
      "\n",
      "“You will not ask me what is the point of envy.--You are determined, I\n",
      "see, to have no curiosity.--You are wise--but _I_ cannot be wise. Emma,\n",
      "I must tell you what you will not ask, though I may wish it unsaid the\n",
      "next moment.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh! then, don't speak it, don't speak it,” she eagerly cried. “Take a\n",
      "little time, consider, do not commit yourself.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Thank you,” said he, in an accent of deep mortification, and not\n",
      "another syllable followed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Emma could not bear to give him pain. He was wishing to confide in\n",
      "her--perhaps to consult her;--cost her what it would, she would listen.\n",
      "She might assist his resolution, or reconcile him to it; she might give\n",
      "just praise to Harriet, or, by representing to him his own independence,\n",
      "relieve him from that state of indecision, which must be more\n",
      "intolerable than any alternative to such a mind as his.--They had\n",
      "reached the house.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You are going in, I suppose?” said he.\n",
      "\n",
      "“No,”--replied Emma--quite confirmed by the depressed manner in which\n",
      "he still spoke--“I should like to take another turn. Mr. Perry is not\n",
      "gone.” And, after proceeding a few steps, she added--“I stopped you\n",
      "ungraciously, just now, Mr. Knightley, and, I am afraid, gave you\n",
      "pain.--But if you have any wish to speak openly to me as a friend, or\n",
      "to ask my opinion of any thing that you may have in contemplation--as\n",
      "a friend, indeed, you may command me.--I will hear whatever you like. I\n",
      "will tell you exactly what I think.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“As a friend!”--repeated Mr. Knightley.--“Emma, that I fear is a\n",
      "word--No, I have no wish--Stay, yes, why should I hesitate?--I\n",
      "have gone too far already for concealment.--Emma, I accept your\n",
      "offer--Extraordinary as it may seem, I accept it, and refer myself to\n",
      "you as a friend.--Tell me, then, have I no chance of ever succeeding?”\n",
      "\n",
      "He stopped in his earnestness to look the question, and the expression\n",
      "of his eyes overpowered her.\n",
      "\n",
      "“My dearest Emma,” said he, “for dearest you will always be, whatever\n",
      "the event of this hour's conversation, my dearest, most beloved\n",
      "Emma--tell me at once. Say 'No,' if it is to be said.”--She could\n",
      "really say nothing.--“You are silent,” he cried, with great animation;\n",
      "“absolutely silent! at present I ask no more.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Emma was almost ready to sink under the agitation of this moment. The\n",
      "dread of being awakened from the happiest dream, was perhaps the most\n",
      "prominent feeling.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I cannot make speeches, Emma:” he soon resumed; and in a tone of\n",
      "such sincere, decided, intelligible tenderness as was tolerably\n",
      "convincing.--“If I loved you less, I might be able to talk about it\n",
      "more. But you know what I am.--You hear nothing but truth from me.--I\n",
      "have blamed you, and lectured you, and you have borne it as no other\n",
      "woman in England would have borne it.--Bear with the truths I would\n",
      "tell you now, dearest Emma, as well as you have borne with them. The\n",
      "manner, perhaps, may have as little to recommend them. God knows, I have\n",
      "been a very indifferent lover.--But you understand me.--Yes, you see,\n",
      "you understand my feelings--and will return them if you can. At present,\n",
      "I ask only to hear, once to hear your voice.”\n",
      "\n",
      "While he spoke, Emma's mind was most busy, and, with all the wonderful\n",
      "velocity of thought, had been able--and yet without losing a word--to\n",
      "catch and comprehend the exact truth of the whole; to see that Harriet's\n",
      "hopes had been entirely groundless, a mistake, a delusion, as complete a\n",
      "delusion as any of her own--that Harriet was nothing; that she was every\n",
      "thing herself; that what she had been saying relative to Harriet\n",
      "had been all taken as the language of her own feelings; and that her\n",
      "agitation, her doubts, her reluctance, her discouragement, had been all\n",
      "received as discouragement from herself.--And not only was there time\n",
      "for these convictions, with all their glow of attendant happiness; there\n",
      "was time also to rejoice that Harriet's secret had not escaped her, and\n",
      "to resolve that it need not, and should not.--It was all the service\n",
      "she could now render her poor friend; for as to any of that heroism of\n",
      "sentiment which might have prompted her to entreat him to transfer his\n",
      "affection from herself to Harriet, as infinitely the most worthy of the\n",
      "two--or even the more simple sublimity of resolving to refuse him at\n",
      "once and for ever, without vouchsafing any motive, because he could not\n",
      "marry them both, Emma had it not. She felt for Harriet, with pain and\n",
      "with contrition; but no flight of generosity run mad, opposing all that\n",
      "could be probable or reasonable, entered her brain. She had led her\n",
      "friend astray, and it would be a reproach to her for ever; but her\n",
      "judgment was as strong as her feelings, and as strong as it had ever\n",
      "been before, in reprobating any such alliance for him, as most unequal\n",
      "and degrading. Her way was clear, though not quite smooth.--She spoke\n",
      "then, on being so entreated.--What did she say?--Just what she ought,\n",
      "of course. A lady always does.--She said enough to shew there need not\n",
      "be despair--and to invite him to say more himself. He _had_ despaired at\n",
      "one period; he had received such an injunction to caution and silence,\n",
      "as for the time crushed every hope;--she had begun by refusing to hear\n",
      "him.--The change had perhaps been somewhat sudden;--her proposal of\n",
      "taking another turn, her renewing the conversation which she had\n",
      "just put an end to, might be a little extraordinary!--She felt its\n",
      "inconsistency; but Mr. Knightley was so obliging as to put up with it,\n",
      "and seek no farther explanation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Seldom, very seldom, does complete truth belong to any human disclosure;\n",
      "seldom can it happen that something is not a little disguised, or a\n",
      "little mistaken; but where, as in this case, though the conduct is\n",
      "mistaken, the feelings are not, it may not be very material.--Mr.\n",
      "Knightley could not impute to Emma a more relenting heart than she\n",
      "possessed, or a heart more disposed to accept of his.\n",
      "\n",
      "He had, in fact, been wholly unsuspicious of his own influence. He had\n",
      "followed her into the shrubbery with no idea of trying it. He had come,\n",
      "in his anxiety to see how she bore Frank Churchill's engagement, with no\n",
      "selfish view, no view at all, but of endeavouring, if she allowed him an\n",
      "opening, to soothe or to counsel her.--The rest had been the work of\n",
      "the moment, the immediate effect of what he heard, on his feelings. The\n",
      "delightful assurance of her total indifference towards Frank Churchill,\n",
      "of her having a heart completely disengaged from him, had given birth\n",
      "to the hope, that, in time, he might gain her affection himself;--but\n",
      "it had been no present hope--he had only, in the momentary conquest of\n",
      "eagerness over judgment, aspired to be told that she did not forbid his\n",
      "attempt to attach her.--The superior hopes which gradually opened were\n",
      "so much the more enchanting.--The affection, which he had been asking\n",
      "to be allowed to create, if he could, was already his!--Within half\n",
      "an hour, he had passed from a thoroughly distressed state of mind, to\n",
      "something so like perfect happiness, that it could bear no other name.\n",
      "\n",
      "_Her_ change was equal.--This one half-hour had given to each the same\n",
      "precious certainty of being beloved, had cleared from each the same\n",
      "degree of ignorance, jealousy, or distrust.--On his side, there had been\n",
      "a long-standing jealousy, old as the arrival, or even the expectation,\n",
      "of Frank Churchill.--He had been in love with Emma, and jealous of Frank\n",
      "Churchill, from about the same period, one sentiment having probably\n",
      "enlightened him as to the other. It was his jealousy of Frank Churchill\n",
      "that had taken him from the country.--The Box Hill party had decided\n",
      "him on going away. He would save himself from witnessing again\n",
      "such permitted, encouraged attentions.--He had gone to learn to be\n",
      "indifferent.--But he had gone to a wrong place. There was too much\n",
      "domestic happiness in his brother's house; woman wore too amiable a form\n",
      "in it; Isabella was too much like Emma--differing only in those striking\n",

      "fond solicitude, so much keen anxiety for her, that he could stay no\n",

      "faultless in spite of all her faults, bore the discovery.\n",
      "\n",
      "He had found her agitated and low.--Frank Churchill was a villain.--\n",

      "solemn resolution of never quitting her father.--She even wept over\n",

      "again through every bitter reproach and sorrowful regret that had ever\n",
      "surrounded it.--She could only resolve at last, that she would still\n",

      "just now for a time from Highbury, and--indulging in one scheme\n",
      "more--nearly resolve, that it might be practicable to get an invitation\n",

      "the only important part of my conduct while belonging to you, which\n",
      "excites my own anxiety, or requires very solicitous explanation. With\n",
      "the greatest respect, and the warmest friendship, do I mention Miss\n",

      "humiliation.--A few words which dropped from him yesterday spoke his\n",
      "opinion, and some censure I acknowledge myself liable to.--My behaviour\n",
      "to Miss Woodhouse indicated, I believe, more than it ought.--In order to\n",
      "assist a concealment so essential to me, I was led on to make more than\n",
      "an allowable use of the sort of intimacy into which we were immediately\n",
      "thrown.--I cannot deny that Miss Woodhouse was my ostensible object--but\n",
      "I am sure you will believe the declaration, that had I not been\n",
      "convinced of her indifference, I would not have been induced by any\n",
      "selfish views to go on.--Amiable and delightful as Miss Woodhouse is,\n",
      "she never gave me the idea of a young woman likely to be attached; and\n",
      "that she was perfectly free from any tendency to being attached to me,\n",
      "was as much my conviction as my wish.--She received my attentions with\n",
      "an easy, friendly, goodhumoured playfulness, which exactly suited me.\n",
      "We seemed to understand each other. From our relative situation, those\n",
      "attentions were her due, and were felt to be so.--Whether Miss Woodhouse\n",
      "began really to understand me before the expiration of that fortnight,\n",
      "I cannot say;--when I called to take leave of her, I remember that I was\n",
      "within a moment of confessing the truth, and I then fancied she was not\n",
      "without suspicion; but I have no doubt of her having since detected me,\n",
      "at least in some degree.--She may not have surmised the whole, but her\n",
      "quickness must have penetrated a part. I cannot doubt it. You will find,\n",
      "whenever the subject becomes freed from its present restraints, that it\n",
      "did not take her wholly by surprize. She frequently gave me hints of it.\n",
      "I remember her telling me at the ball, that I owed Mrs. Elton gratitude\n",
      "for her attentions to Miss Fairfax.--I hope this history of my conduct\n",
      "towards her will be admitted by you and my father as great extenuation\n",
      "of what you saw amiss. While you considered me as having sinned against\n",
      "Emma Woodhouse, I could deserve nothing from either. Acquit me here, and\n",
      "procure for me, when it is allowable, the acquittal and good wishes\n",
      "of that said Emma Woodhouse, whom I regard with so much brotherly\n",
      "affection, as to long to have her as deeply and as happily in love as\n",
      "myself.--Whatever strange things I said or did during that fortnight,\n",
      "you have now a key to. My heart was in Highbury, and my business was to\n",
      "get my body thither as often as might be, and with the least suspicion.\n",

      "the pianoforte so much talked of, I feel it only necessary to say, that\n",
      "its being ordered was absolutely unknown to Miss F--, who would never\n",
      "have allowed me to send it, had any choice been given her.--The\n",
      "delicacy of her mind throughout the whole engagement, my dear madam,\n",
      "is much beyond my power of doing justice to. You will soon, I earnestly\n",
      "hope, know her thoroughly yourself.--No description can describe her.\n",
      "She must tell you herself what she is--yet not by word, for never\n",
      "was there a human creature who would so designedly suppress her own\n",
      "merit.--Since I began this letter, which will be longer than I foresaw,\n",
      "I have heard from her.--She gives a good account of her own health; but\n",
      "as she never complains, I dare not depend. I want to have your opinion\n",
      "of her looks. I know you will soon call on her; she is living in dread\n",
      "of the visit. Perhaps it is paid already. Let me hear from you without\n",
      "delay; I am impatient for a thousand particulars. Remember how few\n",
      "minutes I was at Randalls, and in how bewildered, how mad a state: and\n",
      "I am not much better yet; still insane either from happiness or\n",
      "misery. When I think of the kindness and favour I have met with, of her\n",
      "excellence and patience, and my uncle's generosity, I am mad with joy:\n",
      "but when I recollect all the uneasiness I occasioned her, and how little\n",
      "I deserve to be forgiven, I am mad with anger. If I could but see her\n",
      "again!--But I must not propose it yet. My uncle has been too good for me\n",
      "to encroach.--I must still add to this long letter. You have not heard\n",
      "all that you ought to hear. I could not give any connected detail\n",
      "yesterday; but the suddenness, and, in one light, the unseasonableness\n",
      "with which the affair burst out, needs explanation; for though the event\n",
      "of the 26th ult., as you will conclude, immediately opened to me the\n",
      "happiest prospects, I should not have presumed on such early measures,\n",
      "but from the very particular circumstances, which left me not an hour to\n",
      "lose. I should myself have shrunk from any thing so hasty, and she\n",
      "would have felt every scruple of mine with multiplied strength and\n",
      "refinement.--But I had no choice. The hasty engagement she had entered\n",
      "into with that woman--Here, my dear madam, I was obliged to leave off\n",
      "abruptly, to recollect and compose myself.--I have been walking over\n",
      "the country, and am now, I hope, rational enough to make the rest of\n",
      "my letter what it ought to be.--It is, in fact, a most mortifying\n",
      "retrospect for me. I behaved shamefully. And here I can admit, that\n",
      "my manners to Miss W., in being unpleasant to Miss F., were highly\n",
      "blameable. _She_ disapproved them, which ought to have been enough.--My\n",
      "plea of concealing the truth she did not think sufficient.--She was\n",
      "displeased; I thought unreasonably so: I thought her, on a thousand\n",
      "occasions, unnecessarily scrupulous and cautious: I thought her even\n",
      "cold. But she was always right. If I had followed her judgment, and\n",
      "subdued my spirits to the level of what she deemed proper, I should have\n",
      "escaped the greatest unhappiness I have ever known.--We quarrelled.--\n",
      "Do you remember the morning spent at Donwell?--_There_ every little\n",
      "dissatisfaction that had occurred before came to a crisis. I was late;\n",
      "I met her walking home by herself, and wanted to walk with her, but she\n",
      "would not suffer it. She absolutely refused to allow me, which I then\n",
      "thought most unreasonable. Now, however, I see nothing in it but a very\n",
      "natural and consistent degree of discretion. While I, to blind the\n",
      "world to our engagement, was behaving one hour with objectionable\n",
      "particularity to another woman, was she to be consenting the next to a\n",
      "proposal which might have made every previous caution useless?--Had we\n",
      "been met walking together between Donwell and Highbury, the truth must\n",
      "have been suspected.--I was mad enough, however, to resent.--I doubted\n",
      "her affection. I doubted it more the next day on Box Hill; when,\n",
      "provoked by such conduct on my side, such shameful, insolent neglect\n",
      "of her, and such apparent devotion to Miss W., as it would have been\n",
      "impossible for any woman of sense to endure, she spoke her resentment in\n",
      "a form of words perfectly intelligible to me.--In short, my dear\n",
      "madam, it was a quarrel blameless on her side, abominable on mine; and\n",
      "I returned the same evening to Richmond, though I might have staid with\n",
      "you till the next morning, merely because I would be as angry with\n",
      "her as possible. Even then, I was not such a fool as not to mean to\n",
      "be reconciled in time; but I was the injured person, injured by her\n",
      "coldness, and I went away determined that she should make the first\n",
      "advances.--I shall always congratulate myself that you were not of\n",
      "the Box Hill party. Had you witnessed my behaviour there, I can hardly\n",
      "suppose you would ever have thought well of me again. Its effect upon\n",
      "her appears in the immediate resolution it produced: as soon as she\n",
      "found I was really gone from Randalls, she closed with the offer of that\n",
      "officious Mrs. Elton; the whole system of whose treatment of her, by the\n",
      "bye, has ever filled me with indignation and hatred. I must not quarrel\n",
      "with a spirit of forbearance which has been so richly extended towards\n",
      "myself; but, otherwise, I should loudly protest against the share of it\n",
      "which that woman has known.--'Jane,' indeed!--You will observe that I\n",
      "have not yet indulged myself in calling her by that name, even to you.\n",
      "Think, then, what I must have endured in hearing it bandied between\n",
      "the Eltons with all the vulgarity of needless repetition, and all the\n",
      "insolence of imaginary superiority. Have patience with me, I shall soon\n",
      "have done.--She closed with this offer, resolving to break with me\n",
      "entirely, and wrote the next day to tell me that we never were to meet\n",
      "again.--_She_ _felt_ _the_ _engagement_ _to_ _be_ _a_ _source_ _of_\n",
      "_repentance_ _and_ _misery_ _to_ _each_: _she_ _dissolved_ _it_.--This\n",
      "letter reached me on the very morning of my poor aunt's death. I\n",
      "answered it within an hour; but from the confusion of my mind, and the\n",
      "multiplicity of business falling on me at once, my answer, instead of\n",
      "being sent with all the many other letters of that day, was locked up in\n",

      "a few lines, to satisfy her, remained without any uneasiness.--I was\n",
      "rather disappointed that I did not hear from her again speedily; but I\n",
      "made excuses for her, and was too busy, and--may I add?--too cheerful\n",
      "in my views to be captious.--We removed to Windsor; and two\n",
      "days afterwards I received a parcel from her, my own letters all\n",
      "returned!--and a few lines at the same time by the post, stating her\n",
      "extreme surprize at not having had the smallest reply to her last; and\n",
      "adding, that as silence on such a point could not be misconstrued,\n",
      "and as it must be equally desirable to both to have every subordinate\n",
      "arrangement concluded as soon as possible, she now sent me, by a safe\n",

      "name, the place, I knew all about it, and instantly saw what she had\n",
      "been doing. It was perfectly accordant with that resolution of character\n",
      "which I knew her to possess; and the secrecy she had maintained, as to\n",
      "any such design in her former letter, was equally descriptive of its\n",

      "me.--Imagine the shock; imagine how, till I had actually detected my\n",
      "own blunder, I raved at the blunders of the post.--What was to be\n",
      "done?--One thing only.--I must speak to my uncle. Without his sanction I\n",
      "could not hope to be listened to again.--I spoke; circumstances were\n",
      "in my favour; the late event had softened away his pride, and he was,\n",
      "earlier than I could have anticipated, wholly reconciled and complying;\n",
      "and could say at last, poor man! with a deep sigh, that he wished I\n",
      "might find as much happiness in the marriage state as he had done.--I\n",

      "suffered, and was very sorry--and he was so grateful to Mrs. Weston, and\n",
      "so much in love with Miss Fairfax, and she was so happy herself, that\n",
      "there was no being severe; and could he have entered the room, she must\n",
      "have shaken hands with him as heartily as ever.\n",
      "\n",
      "She thought so well of the letter, that when Mr. Knightley came again,\n",
      "she desired him to read it. She was sure of Mrs. Weston's wishing it to\n",
      "be communicated; especially to one, who, like Mr. Knightley, had seen so\n",
      "much to blame in his conduct.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I shall be very glad to look it over,” said he; “but it seems long. I\n",
      "will take it home with me at night.”\n",
      "\n",
      "But that would not do. Mr. Weston was to call in the evening, and she\n",
      "must return it by him.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I would rather be talking to you,” he replied; “but as it seems a\n",
      "matter of justice, it shall be done.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He began--stopping, however, almost directly to say, “Had I been offered\n",
      "the sight of one of this gentleman's letters to his mother-in-law a few\n",
      "months ago, Emma, it would not have been taken with such indifference.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He proceeded a little farther, reading to himself; and then, with a\n",
      "smile, observed, “Humph! a fine complimentary opening: But it is his\n",
      "way. One man's style must not be the rule of another's. We will not be\n",
      "severe.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It will be natural for me,” he added shortly afterwards, “to speak my\n",
      "opinion aloud as I read. By doing it, I shall feel that I am near you.\n",
      "It will not be so great a loss of time: but if you dislike it--”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Not at all. I should wish it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Knightley returned to his reading with greater alacrity.\n",
      "\n",
      "“He trifles here,” said he, “as to the temptation. He knows he is wrong,\n",
      "and has nothing rational to urge.--Bad.--He ought not to have formed the\n",
      "engagement.--'His father's disposition:'--he is unjust, however, to his\n",
      "father. Mr. Weston's sanguine temper was a blessing on all his upright\n",
      "and honourable exertions; but Mr. Weston earned every present comfort\n",
      "before he endeavoured to gain it.--Very true; he did not come till Miss\n",
      "Fairfax was here.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“And I have not forgotten,” said Emma, “how sure you were that he might\n",
      "have come sooner if he would. You pass it over very handsomely--but you\n",
      "were perfectly right.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I was not quite impartial in my judgment, Emma:--but yet, I think--had\n",
      "_you_ not been in the case--I should still have distrusted him.”\n",
      "\n",
      "When he came to Miss Woodhouse, he was obliged to read the whole of it\n",
      "aloud--all that related to her, with a smile; a look; a shake of the\n",
      "head; a word or two of assent, or disapprobation; or merely of love, as\n",
      "the subject required; concluding, however, seriously, and, after steady\n",
      "reflection, thus--\n",
      "\n",
      "“Very bad--though it might have been worse.--Playing a most dangerous\n",
      "game. Too much indebted to the event for his acquittal.--No judge of\n",
      "his own manners by you.--Always deceived in fact by his own wishes, and\n",
      "regardless of little besides his own convenience.--Fancying you to have\n",
      "fathomed his secret. Natural enough!--his own mind full of intrigue,\n",
      "that he should suspect it in others.--Mystery; Finesse--how they pervert\n",
      "the understanding! My Emma, does not every thing serve to prove more\n",
      "and more the beauty of truth and sincerity in all our dealings with each\n",
      "other?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Emma agreed to it, and with a blush of sensibility on Harriet's account,\n",
      "which she could not give any sincere explanation of.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You had better go on,” said she.\n",
      "\n",
      "He did so, but very soon stopt again to say, “the pianoforte! Ah! That\n",
      "was the act of a very, very young man, one too young to consider whether\n",
      "the inconvenience of it might not very much exceed the pleasure. A\n",
      "boyish scheme, indeed!--I cannot comprehend a man's wishing to give a\n",
      "woman any proof of affection which he knows she would rather dispense\n",
      "with; and he did know that she would have prevented the instrument's\n",
      "coming if she could.”\n",
      "\n",
      "After this, he made some progress without any pause. Frank Churchill's\n",
      "confession of having behaved shamefully was the first thing to call for\n",
      "more than a word in passing.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I perfectly agree with you, sir,”--was then his remark. “You did behave\n",
      "very shamefully. You never wrote a truer line.” And having gone through\n",
      "what immediately followed of the basis of their disagreement, and his\n",
      "persisting to act in direct opposition to Jane Fairfax's sense of right,\n",
      "he made a fuller pause to say, “This is very bad.--He had induced her\n",
      "to place herself, for his sake, in a situation of extreme difficulty and\n",
      "uneasiness, and it should have been his first object to prevent her from\n",
      "suffering unnecessarily.--She must have had much more to contend\n",
      "with, in carrying on the correspondence, than he could. He should have\n",
      "respected even unreasonable scruples, had there been such; but hers were\n",
      "all reasonable. We must look to her one fault, and remember that she\n",
      "had done a wrong thing in consenting to the engagement, to bear that she\n",
      "should have been in such a state of punishment.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Emma knew that he was now getting to the Box Hill party, and grew\n",
      "uncomfortable. Her own behaviour had been so very improper! She was\n",
      "deeply ashamed, and a little afraid of his next look. It was all read,\n",
      "however, steadily, attentively, and without the smallest remark; and,\n",
      "excepting one momentary glance at her, instantly withdrawn, in the fear\n",
      "of giving pain--no remembrance of Box Hill seemed to exist.\n",

      "be a source of repentance and misery to each--she dissolved it.--What a\n",

      "hope it does him some service with you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, certainly it does. He has had great faults, faults of\n",

      "in thinking him likely to be happier than he deserves: but still as he\n",
      "is, beyond a doubt, really attached to Miss Fairfax, and will soon, it\n",
      "may be hoped, have the advantage of being constantly with her, I am very\n",
      "ready to believe his character will improve, and acquire from hers the\n",
      "steadiness and delicacy of principle that it wants. And now, let me talk\n",
      "to you of something else. I have another person's interest at present\n",
      "so much at heart, that I cannot think any longer about Frank Churchill.\n",
      "Ever since I left you this morning, Emma, my mind has been hard at work\n",
      "on one subject.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The subject followed; it was in plain, unaffected, gentlemanlike\n",
      "English, such as Mr. Knightley used even to the woman he was in love\n",
      "with, how to be able to ask her to marry him, without attacking the\n",
      "happiness of her father. Emma's answer was ready at the first word.\n",
      "“While her dear father lived, any change of condition must be impossible\n",
      "for her. She could never quit him.” Part only of this answer, however,\n",
      "was admitted. The impossibility of her quitting her father, Mr.\n",
      "Knightley felt as strongly as herself; but the inadmissibility of any\n",
      "other change, he could not agree to. He had been thinking it over most\n",
      "deeply, most intently; he had at first hoped to induce Mr. Woodhouse to\n",
      "remove with her to Donwell; he had wanted to believe it feasible, but\n",
      "his knowledge of Mr. Woodhouse would not suffer him to deceive himself\n",
      "long; and now he confessed his persuasion, that such a transplantation\n",
      "would be a risk of her father's comfort, perhaps even of his life, which\n",
      "must not be hazarded. Mr. Woodhouse taken from Hartfield!--No, he felt\n",
      "that it ought not to be attempted. But the plan which had arisen on the\n",
      "sacrifice of this, he trusted his dearest Emma would not find in any\n",
      "respect objectionable; it was, that he should be received at Hartfield;\n",
      "that so long as her father's happiness--in other words, his life--required\n",
      "Hartfield to continue her home, it should be his likewise.\n",
      "\n",
      "Of their all removing to Donwell, Emma had already had her own passing\n",
      "thoughts. Like him, she had tried the scheme and rejected it; but such\n",
      "an alternative as this had not occurred to her. She was sensible of all\n",
      "the affection it evinced. She felt that, in quitting Donwell, he must\n",
      "be sacrificing a great deal of independence of hours and habits; that\n",
      "in living constantly with her father, and in no house of his own, there\n",
      "would be much, very much, to be borne with. She promised to think of it,\n",
      "and advised him to think of it more; but he was fully convinced, that no\n",
      "reflection could alter his wishes or his opinion on the subject. He had\n",
      "given it, he could assure her, very long and calm consideration; he had\n",
      "been walking away from William Larkins the whole morning, to have his\n",
      "thoughts to himself.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ah! there is one difficulty unprovided for,” cried Emma. “I am sure\n",
      "William Larkins will not like it. You must get his consent before you\n",
      "ask mine.”\n",
      "\n",
      "She promised, however, to think of it; and pretty nearly promised,\n",
      "moreover, to think of it, with the intention of finding it a very good\n",
      "scheme.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is remarkable, that Emma, in the many, very many, points of view in\n",
      "which she was now beginning to consider Donwell Abbey, was never\n",
      "struck with any sense of injury to her nephew Henry, whose rights as\n",
      "heir-expectant had formerly been so tenaciously regarded. Think she must\n",
      "of the possible difference to the poor little boy; and yet she only\n",
      "gave herself a saucy conscious smile about it, and found amusement in\n",
      "detecting the real cause of that violent dislike of Mr. Knightley's\n",
      "marrying Jane Fairfax, or any body else, which at the time she had\n",
      "wholly imputed to the amiable solicitude of the sister and the aunt.\n",

      "This proposal of his, this plan of marrying and continuing at\n",
      "Hartfield--the more she contemplated it, the more pleasing it became.\n",
      "His evils seemed to lessen, her own advantages to increase, their mutual\n",
      "good to outweigh every drawback. Such a companion for herself in the\n",
      "periods of anxiety and cheerlessness before her!--Such a partner in\n",
      "all those duties and cares to which time must be giving increase of\n",
      "melancholy!\n",
      "\n",
      "She would have been too happy but for poor Harriet; but every blessing\n",
      "of her own seemed to involve and advance the sufferings of her friend,\n",
      "who must now be even excluded from Hartfield. The delightful family\n",
      "party which Emma was securing for herself, poor Harriet must, in mere\n",
      "charitable caution, be kept at a distance from. She would be a loser in\n",
      "every way. Emma could not deplore her future absence as any deduction\n",
      "from her own enjoyment. In such a party, Harriet would be rather a\n",
      "dead weight than otherwise; but for the poor girl herself, it seemed a\n",
      "peculiarly cruel necessity that was to be placing her in such a state of\n",
      "unmerited punishment.\n",
      "\n",
      "In time, of course, Mr. Knightley would be forgotten, that is,\n",
      "supplanted; but this could not be expected to happen very early. Mr.\n",
      "Knightley himself would be doing nothing to assist the cure;--not\n",
      "like Mr. Elton. Mr. Knightley, always so kind, so feeling, so truly\n",
      "considerate for every body, would never deserve to be less worshipped\n",
      "than now; and it really was too much to hope even of Harriet, that she\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "It was a very great relief to Emma to find Harriet as desirous as\n",
      "herself to avoid a meeting. Their intercourse was painful enough by\n",
      "letter. How much worse, had they been obliged to meet!\n",
      "\n",
      "Harriet expressed herself very much as might be supposed, without\n",
      "reproaches, or apparent sense of ill-usage; and yet Emma fancied there\n",
      "was a something of resentment, a something bordering on it in her style,\n",
      "which increased the desirableness of their being separate.--It might be\n",
      "only her own consciousness; but it seemed as if an angel only could have\n",
      "been quite without resentment under such a stroke.\n",
      "\n",
      "She had no difficulty in procuring Isabella's invitation; and she was\n",
      "fortunate in having a sufficient reason for asking it, without resorting\n",
      "to invention.--There was a tooth amiss. Harriet really wished, and\n",
      "had wished some time, to consult a dentist. Mrs. John Knightley was\n",
      "delighted to be of use; any thing of ill health was a recommendation to\n",
      "her--and though not so fond of a dentist as of a Mr. Wingfield, she was\n",
      "quite eager to have Harriet under her care.--When it was thus settled\n",
      "on her sister's side, Emma proposed it to her friend, and found her\n",
      "very persuadable.--Harriet was to go; she was invited for at least a\n",
      "fortnight; she was to be conveyed in Mr. Woodhouse's carriage.--It was\n",
      "all arranged, it was all completed, and Harriet was safe in Brunswick\n",
      "Square.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now Emma could, indeed, enjoy Mr. Knightley's visits; now she could\n",
      "talk, and she could listen with true happiness, unchecked by that sense\n",
      "of injustice, of guilt, of something most painful, which had haunted her\n",
      "when remembering how disappointed a heart was near her, how much might\n",
      "at that moment, and at a little distance, be enduring by the feelings\n",
      "which she had led astray herself.\n",
      "\n",
      "The difference of Harriet at Mrs. Goddard's, or in London, made perhaps\n",
      "an unreasonable difference in Emma's sensations; but she could not think\n",
      "of her in London without objects of curiosity and employment, which must\n",
      "be averting the past, and carrying her out of herself.\n",
      "\n",
      "She would not allow any other anxiety to succeed directly to the place\n",
      "in her mind which Harriet had occupied. There was a communication before\n",
      "her, one which _she_ only could be competent to make--the confession of\n",
      "her engagement to her father; but she would have nothing to do with it\n",
      "at present.--She had resolved to defer the disclosure till Mrs. Weston\n",
      "were safe and well. No additional agitation should be thrown at this\n",
      "period among those she loved--and the evil should not act on herself\n",
      "by anticipation before the appointed time.--A fortnight, at least, of\n",
      "leisure and peace of mind, to crown every warmer, but more agitating,\n",
      "delight, should be hers.\n",
      "\n",
      "She soon resolved, equally as a duty and a pleasure, to employ half an\n",
      "hour of this holiday of spirits in calling on Miss Fairfax.--She ought\n",
      "to go--and she was longing to see her; the resemblance of their present\n",
      "situations increasing every other motive of goodwill. It would be a\n",
      "_secret_ satisfaction; but the consciousness of a similarity of prospect\n",
      "would certainly add to the interest with which she should attend to any\n",
      "thing Jane might communicate.\n",
      "\n",
      "She went--she had driven once unsuccessfully to the door, but had not\n",
      "been into the house since the morning after Box Hill, when poor Jane had\n",
      "been in such distress as had filled her with compassion, though all the\n",
      "worst of her sufferings had been unsuspected.--The fear of being still\n",
      "unwelcome, determined her, though assured of their being at home, to\n",
      "wait in the passage, and send up her name.--She heard Patty announcing\n",
      "it; but no such bustle succeeded as poor Miss Bates had before made so\n",
      "happily intelligible.--No; she heard nothing but the instant reply of,\n",
      "“Beg her to walk up;”--and a moment afterwards she was met on the stairs\n",
      "by Jane herself, coming eagerly forward, as if no other reception of her\n",
      "were felt sufficient.--Emma had never seen her look so well, so lovely,\n",
      "so engaging. There was consciousness, animation, and warmth; there was\n",
      "every thing which her countenance or manner could ever have wanted.--\n",
      "She came forward with an offered hand; and said, in a low, but very\n",
      "feeling tone,\n",
      "\n",
      "“This is most kind, indeed!--Miss Woodhouse, it is impossible for me\n",
      "to express--I hope you will believe--Excuse me for being so entirely\n",
      "without words.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Emma was gratified, and would soon have shewn no want of words, if the\n",
      "sound of Mrs. Elton's voice from the sitting-room had not checked\n",
      "her, and made it expedient to compress all her friendly and all her\n",
      "congratulatory sensations into a very, very earnest shake of the hand.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Bates and Mrs. Elton were together. Miss Bates was out, which\n",
      "accounted for the previous tranquillity. Emma could have wished Mrs.\n",
      "Elton elsewhere; but she was in a humour to have patience with every\n",
      "body; and as Mrs. Elton met her with unusual graciousness, she hoped the\n",
      "rencontre would do them no harm.\n",
      "\n",
      "She soon believed herself to penetrate Mrs. Elton's thoughts, and\n",
      "understand why she was, like herself, in happy spirits; it was being in\n",
      "Miss Fairfax's confidence, and fancying herself acquainted with what was\n",
      "still a secret to other people. Emma saw symptoms of it immediately in\n",
      "the expression of her face; and while paying her own compliments to Mrs.\n",
      "Bates, and appearing to attend to the good old lady's replies, she saw\n",
      "her with a sort of anxious parade of mystery fold up a letter which she\n",
      "had apparently been reading aloud to Miss Fairfax, and return it into\n",
      "the purple and gold reticule by her side, saying, with significant nods,\n",
      "\n",
      "“We can finish this some other time, you know. You and I shall not want\n",
      "opportunities. And, in fact, you have heard all the essential already. I\n",
      "only wanted to prove to you that Mrs. S. admits our apology, and is\n",
      "not offended. You see how delightfully she writes. Oh! she is a sweet\n",
      "creature! You would have doated on her, had you gone.--But not a word\n",
      "more. Let us be discreet--quite on our good behaviour.--Hush!--You\n",
      "remember those lines--I forget the poem at this moment:\n",
      "\n",

      "Now I say, my dear, in _our_ case, for _lady_, read----mum! a word to\n",

      "your heart at ease as to Mrs. S.--_My_ representation, you see, has\n",

      "it so much the worse. And then not to find him at home! I assure you\n",
      "I am not at all pleased. And no apology left, no message for me. The\n",
      "housekeeper declared she knew nothing of my being expected.--Very\n",
      "extraordinary!--And nobody knew at all which way he was gone. Perhaps\n",

      "indeed, and that she had not a syllable to say for him.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I cannot imagine,” said Mrs. Elton, (feeling the indignity as a wife\n",
      "ought to do,) “I cannot imagine how he could do such a thing by you, of\n",
      "all people in the world! The very last person whom one should expect to\n",
      "be forgotten!--My dear Mr. E., he must have left a message for you, I am\n",
      "sure he must.--Not even Knightley could be so very eccentric;--and his\n",
      "servants forgot it. Depend upon it, that was the case: and very likely\n",
      "to happen with the Donwell servants, who are all, I have often observed,\n",
      "extremely awkward and remiss.--I am sure I would not have such a\n",
      "creature as his Harry stand at our sideboard for any consideration. And\n",
      "as for Mrs. Hodges, Wright holds her very cheap indeed.--She promised\n",
      "Wright a receipt, and never sent it.”\n",

      "believe him.--William seemed rather out of humour. He did not know what\n",
      "was come to his master lately, he said, but he could hardly ever get the\n",
      "speech of him. I have nothing to do with William's wants, but it really\n",
      "is of very great importance that _I_ should see Knightley to-day; and it\n",
      "becomes a matter, therefore, of very serious inconvenience that I should\n",
      "have had this hot walk to no purpose.”\n",

      "Mr. Elton, if not towards William Larkins.\n",
      "\n",
      "She was pleased, on taking leave, to find Miss Fairfax determined to\n",
      "attend her out of the room, to go with her even downstairs; it gave her\n",
      "an opportunity which she immediately made use of, to say,\n",
      "\n",
      "“It is as well, perhaps, that I have not had the possibility. Had you\n",

      "infinitely more becoming to her than all the elegance of all her usual\n",
      "composure--“there would have been no danger. The danger would have\n",
      "been of my wearying you. You could not have gratified me more than\n",
      "by expressing an interest--. Indeed, Miss Woodhouse, (speaking more\n",
      "collectedly,) with the consciousness which I have of misconduct, very\n",
      "great misconduct, it is particularly consoling to me to know that those\n",
      "of my friends, whose good opinion is most worth preserving, are not\n",
      "disgusted to such a degree as to--I have not time for half that I could\n",
      "wish to say. I long to make apologies, excuses, to urge something for\n",
      "myself. I feel it so very due. But, unfortunately--in short, if your\n",
      "compassion does not stand my friend--”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh! you are too scrupulous, indeed you are,” cried Emma warmly, and\n",
      "taking her hand. “You owe me no apologies; and every body to whom you\n",
      "might be supposed to owe them, is so perfectly satisfied, so delighted\n",
      "even--”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You are very kind, but I know what my manners were to you.--So\n",
      "cold and artificial!--I had always a part to act.--It was a life of\n",

      "any view of making a match for her, hereafter, with either of Isabella's\n",
      "sons; but she was convinced that a daughter would suit both father\n",

      "older--and even Mr. Weston might be growing older ten years hence--to\n",
      "have his fireside enlivened by the sports and the nonsense, the freaks\n",

      "one could doubt that a daughter would be most to her; and it would be\n",

      "\n",
      "“Do you?--I have no doubt. Nature gave you understanding:--Miss Taylor\n",

      "\n",
      "“I remember once calling you 'George,' in one of my amiable fits, about\n",

      "follies--her wilful intimacy with Harriet Smith; but it was too tender a\n",
      "subject.--She could not enter on it.--Harriet was very seldom mentioned\n",
      "between them. This, on his side, might merely proceed from her not being\n",
      "thought of; but Emma was rather inclined to attribute it to delicacy,\n",

      "declining. She was aware herself, that, parting under any other\n",
      "circumstances, they certainly should have corresponded more, and that\n",
      "her intelligence would not have rested, as it now almost wholly did, on\n",
      "Isabella's letters. He might observe that it was so. The pain of being\n",

      "the pain of having made Harriet unhappy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Isabella sent quite as good an account of her visitor as could be\n",

      "since that business had been over, she did not appear to find Harriet\n",
      "different from what she had known her before.--Isabella, to be sure,\n",
      "was no very quick observer; yet if Harriet had not been equal to playing\n",
      "with the children, it would not have escaped her. Emma's comforts and\n",
      "hopes were most agreeably carried on, by Harriet's being to stay longer;\n",
      "her fortnight was likely to be a month at least. Mr. and Mrs. John\n",

      "your side of the question; all the merit on mine. I wish I may not\n",

      "\n",
      "“Yes, yes--but I am amused that he should have seen so far into my\n",

      "difference in my spirits or conversation that could prepare him at\n",
      "this time for my marrying any more than at another.--But it was so, I\n",
      "suppose. I dare say there was a difference when I was staying with them\n",
      "the other day. I believe I did not play with the children quite so much\n",

      "Knightley's absence, or when it came to the point her heart would have\n",
      "failed her, and she must have put it off; but Mr. Knightley was to come\n",
      "at such a time, and follow up the beginning she was to make.--She was\n",
      "forced to speak, and to speak cheerfully too. She must not make it a\n",
      "more decided subject of misery to him, by a melancholy tone herself.\n",
      "She must not appear to think it a misfortune.--With all the spirits she\n",

      "in a few words, said, that if his consent and approbation could be\n",
      "obtained--which, she trusted, would be attended with no difficulty,\n",

      "\n",
      "Poor man!--it was at first a considerable shock to him, and he tried\n",
      "earnestly to dissuade her from it. She was reminded, more than once, of\n",
      "having always said she would never marry, and assured that it would be\n",
      "a great deal better for her to remain single; and told of poor Isabella,\n",
      "and poor Miss Taylor.--But it would not do. Emma hung about him\n",
      "affectionately, and smiled, and said it must be so; and that he must\n",

      "so proper, suitable, and unexceptionable a connexion, and in one\n",
      "respect, one point of the highest importance, so peculiarly eligible,\n",
      "so singularly fortunate, that now it seemed as if Emma could not safely\n",
      "have attached herself to any other creature, and that she had herself\n",
      "been the stupidest of beings in not having thought of it, and wished it\n",
      "long ago.--How very few of those men in a rank of life to address Emma\n",

      "the subject better than by saying--“Those matters will take care of\n",
      "themselves; the young people will find a way.” But here there was\n",
      "nothing to be shifted off in a wild speculation on the future. It was\n",
      "all right, all open, all equal. No sacrifice on any side worth the name.\n",

      "\n",
      "Mrs. Weston, with her baby on her knee, indulging in such reflections\n",
      "as these, was one of the happiest women in the world. If any thing could\n",

      "of the match, and rejoiced in them with all the constancy of his wife;\n",
      "but the wonder of it was very soon nothing; and by the end of an hour he\n",
      "was not far from believing that he had always foreseen it.\n",

      "of course, to Mrs. Cole, Mrs. Perry, and Mrs. Elton, immediately\n",
      "afterwards. It was no more than the principals were prepared for; they\n",
      "had calculated from the time of its being known at Randalls, how soon it\n",
      "would be over Highbury; and were thinking of themselves, as the evening\n",

      "In general, it was a very well approved match. Some might think him, and\n",

      "and another might predict disagreements among their servants; but yet,\n",
      "upon the whole, there was no serious objection raised, except in one\n",
      "habitation, the Vicarage.--There, the surprize was not softened by any\n",
      "satisfaction. Mr. Elton cared little about it, compared with his wife;\n",
      "he only hoped “the young lady's pride would now be contented;” and\n",
      "supposed “she had always meant to catch Knightley if she could;” and,\n",
      "on the point of living at Hartfield, could daringly exclaim, “Rather\n",
      "he than I!”--But Mrs. Elton was very much discomposed indeed.--“Poor\n",
      "Knightley! poor fellow!--sad business for him.”--She was extremely\n",
      "concerned; for, though very eccentric, he had a thousand good\n",
      "qualities.--How could he be so taken in?--Did not think him at all in\n",

      "pleasant intercourse with him.--How happy he had been to come and dine\n",
      "with them whenever they asked him! But that would be all over now.--Poor\n",
      "fellow!--No more exploring parties to Donwell made for _her_. Oh!\n",
      "no; there would be a Mrs. Knightley to throw cold water on every\n",
      "thing.--Extremely disagreeable! But she was not at all sorry that\n",
      "she had abused the housekeeper the other day.--Shocking plan, living\n",
      "together. It would never do. She knew a family near Maple Grove who\n",

      "Time passed on. A few more to-morrows, and the party from London would\n",
      "be arriving. It was an alarming change; and Emma was thinking of it one\n",
      "morning, as what must bring a great deal to agitate and grieve her, when\n",
      "Mr. Knightley came in, and distressing thoughts were put by. After the\n",
      "first chat of pleasure he was silent; and then, in a graver tone, began\n",
      "with,\n",
      "\n",
      "“I have something to tell you, Emma; some news.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Good or bad?” said she, quickly, looking up in his face.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I do not know which it ought to be called.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh! good I am sure.--I see it in your countenance. You are trying not\n",

      "\n",
      "“Indeed! but why so?--I can hardly imagine that any thing which pleases\n",
      "or amuses you, should not please and amuse me too.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“There is one subject,” he replied, “I hope but one, on which we do not\n",
      "think alike.” He paused a moment, again smiling, with his eyes fixed on\n",
      "her face. “Does nothing occur to you?--Do not you recollect?--Harriet\n",
      "Smith.”\n",
      "\n",

      "“No, I have not; I know nothing; pray tell me.”\n",

      "“You are prepared for the worst, I see--and very bad it is. Harriet\n",
      "Smith marries Robert Martin.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Emma gave a start, which did not seem like being prepared--and her eyes,\n",
      "in eager gaze, said, “No, this is impossible!” but her lips were closed.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It is so, indeed,” continued Mr. Knightley; “I have it from Robert\n",
      "Martin himself. He left me not half an hour ago.”\n",
      "\n",
      "She was still looking at him with the most speaking amazement.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You like it, my Emma, as little as I feared.--I wish our opinions were\n",
      "the same. But in time they will. Time, you may be sure, will make one\n",
      "or the other of us think differently; and, in the meanwhile, we need not\n",
      "talk much on the subject.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You mistake me, you quite mistake me,” she replied, exerting herself.\n",
      "“It is not that such a circumstance would now make me unhappy, but I\n",
      "cannot believe it. It seems an impossibility!--You cannot mean to say,\n",
      "that Harriet Smith has accepted Robert Martin. You cannot mean that he\n",
      "has even proposed to her again--yet. You only mean, that he intends it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I mean that he has done it,” answered Mr. Knightley, with smiling but\n",
      "determined decision, “and been accepted.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Good God!” she cried.--“Well!”--Then having recourse to her workbasket,\n",
      "in excuse for leaning down her face, and concealing all the exquisite\n",
      "feelings of delight and entertainment which she knew she must be\n",
      "expressing, she added, “Well, now tell me every thing; make this\n",
      "intelligible to me. How, where, when?--Let me know it all. I never was\n",
      "more surprized--but it does not make me unhappy, I assure you.--How--how\n",
      "has it been possible?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It is a very simple story. He went to town on business three days ago,\n",
      "and I got him to take charge of some papers which I was wanting to send\n",
      "to John.--He delivered these papers to John, at his chambers, and was\n",
      "asked by him to join their party the same evening to Astley's. They were\n",
      "going to take the two eldest boys to Astley's. The party was to be our\n",
      "brother and sister, Henry, John--and Miss Smith. My friend Robert could\n",
      "not resist. They called for him in their way; were all extremely amused;\n",
      "and my brother asked him to dine with them the next day--which he\n",
      "did--and in the course of that visit (as I understand) he found an\n",
      "opportunity of speaking to Harriet; and certainly did not speak\n",
      "in vain.--She made him, by her acceptance, as happy even as he is\n",
      "deserving. He came down by yesterday's coach, and was with me this\n",
      "morning immediately after breakfast, to report his proceedings, first\n",
      "on my affairs, and then on his own. This is all that I can relate of\n",
      "the how, where, and when. Your friend Harriet will make a much\n",
      "longer history when you see her.--She will give you all the minute\n",
      "particulars, which only woman's language can make interesting.--In our\n",
      "communications we deal only in the great.--However, I must say, that\n",
      "Robert Martin's heart seemed for _him_, and to _me_, very overflowing;\n",
      "and that he did mention, without its being much to the purpose, that\n",
      "on quitting their box at Astley's, my brother took charge of Mrs. John\n",
      "Knightley and little John, and he followed with Miss Smith and Henry;\n",
      "and that at one time they were in such a crowd, as to make Miss Smith\n",
      "rather uneasy.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He stopped.--Emma dared not attempt any immediate reply. To speak, she\n",
      "was sure would be to betray a most unreasonable degree of happiness.\n",
      "She must wait a moment, or he would think her mad. Her silence disturbed\n",
      "him; and after observing her a little while, he added,\n",
      "\n",
      "“Emma, my love, you said that this circumstance would not now make you\n",
      "unhappy; but I am afraid it gives you more pain than you expected. His\n",
      "situation is an evil--but you must consider it as what satisfies your\n",
      "friend; and I will answer for your thinking better and better of him\n",
      "as you know him more. His good sense and good principles would delight\n",
      "you.--As far as the man is concerned, you could not wish your friend\n",
      "in better hands. His rank in society I would alter if I could, which is\n",
      "saying a great deal I assure you, Emma.--You laugh at me about William\n",
      "Larkins; but I could quite as ill spare Robert Martin.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He wanted her to look up and smile; and having now brought herself not\n",
      "to smile too broadly--she did--cheerfully answering,\n",
      "\n",
      "“You need not be at any pains to reconcile me to the match. I think\n",
      "Harriet is doing extremely well. _Her_ connexions may be worse than\n",
      "_his_. In respectability of character, there can be no doubt that they\n",
      "are. I have been silent from surprize merely, excessive surprize. You\n",
      "cannot imagine how suddenly it has come on me! how peculiarly unprepared\n",
      "I was!--for I had reason to believe her very lately more determined\n",
      "against him, much more, than she was before.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You ought to know your friend best,” replied Mr. Knightley; “but I\n",
      "should say she was a good-tempered, soft-hearted girl, not likely to be\n",
      "very, very determined against any young man who told her he loved her.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Emma could not help laughing as she answered, “Upon my word, I believe\n",
      "you know her quite as well as I do.--But, Mr. Knightley, are you\n",
      "perfectly sure that she has absolutely and downright _accepted_ him.\n",
      "I could suppose she might in time--but can she already?--Did not you\n",
      "misunderstand him?--You were both talking of other things; of business,\n",
      "shows of cattle, or new drills--and might not you, in the confusion of\n",
      "so many subjects, mistake him?--It was not Harriet's hand that he was\n",
      "certain of--it was the dimensions of some famous ox.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The contrast between the countenance and air of Mr. Knightley and Robert\n",
      "Martin was, at this moment, so strong to Emma's feelings, and so strong\n",
      "was the recollection of all that had so recently passed on Harriet's\n",
      "side, so fresh the sound of those words, spoken with such emphasis,\n",
      "“No, I hope I know better than to think of Robert Martin,” that she was\n",
      "really expecting the intelligence to prove, in some measure, premature.\n",
      "It could not be otherwise.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Do you dare say this?” cried Mr. Knightley. “Do you dare to suppose me\n",
      "so great a blockhead, as not to know what a man is talking of?--What do\n",
      "you deserve?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh! I always deserve the best treatment, because I never put up with\n",
      "any other; and, therefore, you must give me a plain, direct answer. Are\n",
      "you quite sure that you understand the terms on which Mr. Martin and\n",
      "Harriet now are?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I am quite sure,” he replied, speaking very distinctly, “that he\n",
      "told me she had accepted him; and that there was no obscurity, nothing\n",
      "doubtful, in the words he used; and I think I can give you a proof that\n",
      "it must be so. He asked my opinion as to what he was now to do. He knew\n",
      "of no one but Mrs. Goddard to whom he could apply for information of\n",
      "her relations or friends. Could I mention any thing more fit to be done,\n",
      "than to go to Mrs. Goddard? I assured him that I could not. Then, he\n",
      "said, he would endeavour to see her in the course of this day.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I am perfectly satisfied,” replied Emma, with the brightest smiles,\n",
      "“and most sincerely wish them happy.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You are materially changed since we talked on this subject before.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I hope so--for at that time I was a fool.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“And I am changed also; for I am now very willing to grant you all\n",
      "Harriet's good qualities. I have taken some pains for your sake, and for\n",
      "Robert Martin's sake, (whom I have always had reason to believe as much\n",
      "in love with her as ever,) to get acquainted with her. I have often\n",
      "talked to her a good deal. You must have seen that I did. Sometimes,\n",
      "indeed, I have thought you were half suspecting me of pleading poor\n",
      "Martin's cause, which was never the case; but, from all my observations,\n",
      "I am convinced of her being an artless, amiable girl, with very good\n",
      "notions, very seriously good principles, and placing her happiness in\n",
      "the affections and utility of domestic life.--Much of this, I have no\n",
      "doubt, she may thank you for.”\n",

      "\n",
      "She checked herself, however, and submitted quietly to a little more\n",
      "praise than she deserved.\n",
      "\n",
      "Their conversation was soon afterwards closed by the entrance of her\n",
      "father. She was not sorry. She wanted to be alone. Her mind was in a\n",
      "state of flutter and wonder, which made it impossible for her to be\n",
      "collected. She was in dancing, singing, exclaiming spirits; and till she\n",
      "had moved about, and talked to herself, and laughed and reflected, she\n",
      "could be fit for nothing rational.\n",
      "\n",
      "Her father's business was to announce James's being gone out to put the\n",
      "horses to, preparatory to their now daily drive to Randalls; and she\n",
      "had, therefore, an immediate excuse for disappearing.\n",
      "\n",
      "The joy, the gratitude, the exquisite delight of her sensations may be\n",
      "imagined. The sole grievance and alloy thus removed in the prospect of\n",
      "Harriet's welfare, she was really in danger of becoming too happy for\n",
      "security.--What had she to wish for? Nothing, but to grow more worthy of\n",
      "him, whose intentions and judgment had been ever so superior to her own.\n",
      "Nothing, but that the lessons of her past folly might teach her humility\n",
      "and circumspection in future.\n",
      "\n",
      "Serious she was, very serious in her thankfulness, and in her\n",
      "resolutions; and yet there was no preventing a laugh, sometimes in the\n",
      "very midst of them. She must laugh at such a close! Such an end of the\n",
      "doleful disappointment of five weeks back! Such a heart--such a Harriet!\n",
      "\n",
      "Now there would be pleasure in her returning--Every thing would be a\n",
      "pleasure. It would be a great pleasure to know Robert Martin.\n",
      "\n",
      "High in the rank of her most serious and heartfelt felicities, was the\n",
      "reflection that all necessity of concealment from Mr. Knightley would\n",
      "soon be over. The disguise, equivocation, mystery, so hateful to her to\n",
      "practise, might soon be over. She could now look forward to giving him\n",
      "that full and perfect confidence which her disposition was most ready to\n",
      "welcome as a duty.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the gayest and happiest spirits she set forward with her father; not\n",
      "always listening, but always agreeing to what he said; and, whether in\n",
      "speech or silence, conniving at the comfortable persuasion of his\n",
      "being obliged to go to Randalls every day, or poor Mrs. Weston would be\n",
      "disappointed.\n",
      "\n",
      "They arrived.--Mrs. Weston was alone in the drawing-room:--but hardly\n",
      "had they been told of the baby, and Mr. Woodhouse received the thanks\n",
      "for coming, which he asked for, when a glimpse was caught through the\n",
      "blind, of two figures passing near the window.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It is Frank and Miss Fairfax,” said Mrs. Weston. “I was just going to\n",
      "tell you of our agreeable surprize in seeing him arrive this morning. He\n",
      "stays till to-morrow, and Miss Fairfax has been persuaded to spend the\n",
      "day with us.--They are coming in, I hope.”\n",
      "\n",
      "In half a minute they were in the room. Emma was extremely glad to\n",
      "see him--but there was a degree of confusion--a number of embarrassing\n",
      "recollections on each side. They met readily and smiling, but with a\n",
      "consciousness which at first allowed little to be said; and having all\n",
      "sat down again, there was for some time such a blank in the circle, that\n",
      "Emma began to doubt whether the wish now indulged, which she had long\n",
      "felt, of seeing Frank Churchill once more, and of seeing him with Jane,\n",
      "would yield its proportion of pleasure. When Mr. Weston joined the\n",
      "party, however, and when the baby was fetched, there was no longer a\n",
      "want of subject or animation--or of courage and opportunity for Frank\n",
      "Churchill to draw near her and say,\n",
      "\n",
      "“I have to thank you, Miss Woodhouse, for a very kind forgiving message\n",
      "in one of Mrs. Weston's letters. I hope time has not made you less\n",
      "willing to pardon. I hope you do not retract what you then said.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No, indeed,” cried Emma, most happy to begin, “not in the least. I am\n",
      "particularly glad to see and shake hands with you--and to give you joy\n",
      "in person.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He thanked her with all his heart, and continued some time to speak with\n",
      "serious feeling of his gratitude and happiness.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Is not she looking well?” said he, turning his eyes towards Jane.\n",
      "“Better than she ever used to do?--You see how my father and Mrs. Weston\n",
      "doat upon her.”\n",
      "\n",
      "But his spirits were soon rising again, and with laughing eyes, after\n",
      "mentioning the expected return of the Campbells, he named the name of\n",
      "Dixon.--Emma blushed, and forbade its being pronounced in her hearing.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I can never think of it,” she cried, “without extreme shame.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“The shame,” he answered, “is all mine, or ought to be. But is it\n",
      "possible that you had no suspicion?--I mean of late. Early, I know, you\n",
      "had none.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I never had the smallest, I assure you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“That appears quite wonderful. I was once very near--and I wish I\n",
      "had--it would have been better. But though I was always doing wrong\n",
      "things, they were very bad wrong things, and such as did me no\n",
      "service.--It would have been a much better transgression had I broken\n",
      "the bond of secrecy and told you every thing.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It is not now worth a regret,” said Emma.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I have some hope,” resumed he, “of my uncle's being persuaded to pay a\n",
      "visit at Randalls; he wants to be introduced to her. When the Campbells\n",
      "are returned, we shall meet them in London, and continue there, I trust,\n",
      "till we may carry her northward.--But now, I am at such a distance from\n",
      "her--is not it hard, Miss Woodhouse?--Till this morning, we have not\n",
      "once met since the day of reconciliation. Do not you pity me?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Emma spoke her pity so very kindly, that with a sudden accession of gay\n",
      "thought, he cried,\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ah! by the bye,” then sinking his voice, and looking demure for the\n",
      "moment--“I hope Mr. Knightley is well?” He paused.--She coloured and\n",
      "laughed.--“I know you saw my letter, and think you may remember my wish\n",
      "in your favour. Let me return your congratulations.--I assure you that\n",
      "I have heard the news with the warmest interest and satisfaction.--He is\n",
      "a man whom I cannot presume to praise.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Emma was delighted, and only wanted him to go on in the same style; but\n",
      "his mind was the next moment in his own concerns and with his own Jane,\n",
      "and his next words were,\n",
      "\n",
      "“Did you ever see such a skin?--such smoothness! such delicacy!--and\n",
      "yet without being actually fair.--One cannot call her fair. It is a\n",
      "most uncommon complexion, with her dark eye-lashes and hair--a most\n",
      "distinguishing complexion! So peculiarly the lady in it.--Just colour\n",
      "enough for beauty.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I have always admired her complexion,” replied Emma, archly; “but\n",
      "do not I remember the time when you found fault with her for being so\n",
      "pale?--When we first began to talk of her.--Have you quite forgotten?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh! no--what an impudent dog I was!--How could I dare--”\n",
      "\n",
      "But he laughed so heartily at the recollection, that Emma could not help\n",
      "saying,\n",
      "\n",
      "“I do suspect that in the midst of your perplexities at that time, you\n",
      "had very great amusement in tricking us all.--I am sure you had.--I am\n",
      "sure it was a consolation to you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh! no, no, no--how can you suspect me of such a thing? I was the most\n",
      "miserable wretch!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Not quite so miserable as to be insensible to mirth. I am sure it was a\n",
      "source of high entertainment to you, to feel that you were taking us\n",
      "all in.--Perhaps I am the readier to suspect, because, to tell you the\n",
      "truth, I think it might have been some amusement to myself in the same\n",
      "situation. I think there is a little likeness between us.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He bowed.\n",
      "\n",
      "“If not in our dispositions,” she presently added, with a look of true\n",
      "sensibility, “there is a likeness in our destiny; the destiny which bids\n",
      "fair to connect us with two characters so much superior to our own.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“True, true,” he answered, warmly. “No, not true on your side. You can\n",
      "have no superior, but most true on mine.--She is a complete angel. Look\n",
      "at her. Is not she an angel in every gesture? Observe the turn of her\n",
      "throat. Observe her eyes, as she is looking up at my father.--You will\n",
      "be glad to hear (inclining his head, and whispering seriously) that my\n",
      "uncle means to give her all my aunt's jewels. They are to be new set.\n",
      "I am resolved to have some in an ornament for the head. Will not it be\n",
      "beautiful in her dark hair?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Very beautiful, indeed,” replied Emma; and she spoke so kindly, that he\n",
      "gratefully burst out,\n",
      "\n",
      "“How delighted I am to see you again! and to see you in such excellent\n",
      "looks!--I would not have missed this meeting for the world. I should\n",
      "certainly have called at Hartfield, had you failed to come.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The others had been talking of the child, Mrs. Weston giving an account\n",
      "of a little alarm she had been under, the evening before, from the\n",
      "infant's appearing not quite well. She believed she had been foolish,\n",
      "but it had alarmed her, and she had been within half a minute of sending\n",
      "for Mr. Perry. Perhaps she ought to be ashamed, but Mr. Weston had been\n",
      "almost as uneasy as herself.--In ten minutes, however, the child had\n",
      "been perfectly well again. This was her history; and particularly\n",
      "interesting it was to Mr. Woodhouse, who commended her very much for\n",
      "thinking of sending for Perry, and only regretted that she had not done\n",
      "it. “She should always send for Perry, if the child appeared in the\n",
      "slightest degree disordered, were it only for a moment. She could not be\n",
      "too soon alarmed, nor send for Perry too often. It was a pity, perhaps,\n",
      "that he had not come last night; for, though the child seemed well now,\n",
      "very well considering, it would probably have been better if Perry had\n",
      "seen it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Frank Churchill caught the name.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Perry!” said he to Emma, and trying, as he spoke, to catch Miss\n",
      "Fairfax's eye. “My friend Mr. Perry! What are they saying about Mr.\n",
      "Perry?--Has he been here this morning?--And how does he travel now?--Has\n",
      "he set up his carriage?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Emma soon recollected, and understood him; and while she joined in the\n",
      "laugh, it was evident from Jane's countenance that she too was really\n",
      "hearing him, though trying to seem deaf.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Such an extraordinary dream of mine!” he cried. “I can never think of\n",
      "it without laughing.--She hears us, she hears us, Miss Woodhouse. I see\n",
      "it in her cheek, her smile, her vain attempt to frown. Look at her. Do\n",
      "not you see that, at this instant, the very passage of her own letter,\n",
      "which sent me the report, is passing under her eye--that the whole\n",
      "blunder is spread before her--that she can attend to nothing else,\n",
      "though pretending to listen to the others?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Jane was forced to smile completely, for a moment; and the smile partly\n",
      "remained as she turned towards him, and said in a conscious, low, yet\n",
      "steady voice,\n",
      "\n",
      "“How you can bear such recollections, is astonishing to me!--They\n",
      "_will_ sometimes obtrude--but how you can court them!”\n",
      "\n",
      "He had a great deal to say in return, and very entertainingly; but\n",
      "Emma's feelings were chiefly with Jane, in the argument; and on leaving\n",
      "Randalls, and falling naturally into a comparison of the two men, she\n",
      "felt, that pleased as she had been to see Frank Churchill, and really\n",
      "regarding him as she did with friendship, she had never been more\n",
      "sensible of Mr. Knightley's high superiority of character. The happiness\n",
      "of this most happy day, received its completion, in the animated\n",
      "contemplation of his worth which this comparison produced.\n",

      "CHAPTER XIX\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "If Emma had still, at intervals, an anxious feeling for Harriet, a\n",
      "momentary doubt of its being possible for her to be really cured of her\n",
      "attachment to Mr. Knightley, and really able to accept another man from\n",
      "unbiased inclination, it was not long that she had to suffer from the\n",
      "recurrence of any such uncertainty. A very few days brought the party\n",
      "from London, and she had no sooner an opportunity of being one hour\n",
      "alone with Harriet, than she became perfectly satisfied--unaccountable\n",
      "as it was!--that Robert Martin had thoroughly supplanted Mr. Knightley,\n",
      "and was now forming all her views of happiness.\n",
      "\n",
      "Harriet was a little distressed--did look a little foolish at first:\n",
      "but having once owned that she had been presumptuous and silly, and\n",
      "self-deceived, before, her pain and confusion seemed to die away with\n",
      "the words, and leave her without a care for the past, and with the\n",
      "fullest exultation in the present and future; for, as to her friend's\n",
      "approbation, Emma had instantly removed every fear of that nature, by\n",
      "meeting her with the most unqualified congratulations.--Harriet was\n",
      "most happy to give every particular of the evening at Astley's, and the\n",
      "dinner the next day; she could dwell on it all with the utmost delight.\n",
      "But what did such particulars explain?--The fact was, as Emma could now\n",
      "acknowledge, that Harriet had always liked Robert Martin; and that his\n",
      "continuing to love her had been irresistible.--Beyond this, it must ever\n",
      "be unintelligible to Emma.\n",
      "\n",
      "The event, however, was most joyful; and every day was giving her fresh\n",
      "reason for thinking so.--Harriet's parentage became known. She proved\n",
      "to be the daughter of a tradesman, rich enough to afford her the\n",
      "comfortable maintenance which had ever been hers, and decent enough to\n",
      "have always wished for concealment.--Such was the blood of gentility\n",
      "which Emma had formerly been so ready to vouch for!--It was likely to\n",
      "be as untainted, perhaps, as the blood of many a gentleman: but what\n",
      "a connexion had she been preparing for Mr. Knightley--or for the\n",
      "Churchills--or even for Mr. Elton!--The stain of illegitimacy,\n",
      "unbleached by nobility or wealth, would have been a stain indeed.\n",
      "\n",
      "No objection was raised on the father's side; the young man was treated\n",
      "liberally; it was all as it should be: and as Emma became acquainted\n",
      "with Robert Martin, who was now introduced at Hartfield, she fully\n",
      "acknowledged in him all the appearance of sense and worth which could\n",
      "bid fairest for her little friend. She had no doubt of Harriet's\n",
      "happiness with any good-tempered man; but with him, and in the home he\n",
      "offered, there would be the hope of more, of security, stability, and\n",
      "improvement. She would be placed in the midst of those who loved her,\n",
      "and who had better sense than herself; retired enough for safety,\n",
      "and occupied enough for cheerfulness. She would be never led into\n",
      "temptation, nor left for it to find her out. She would be respectable\n",
      "and happy; and Emma admitted her to be the luckiest creature in the\n",
      "world, to have created so steady and persevering an affection in such a\n",
      "man;--or, if not quite the luckiest, to yield only to herself.\n",
      "\n",
      "Harriet, necessarily drawn away by her engagements with the Martins,\n",
      "was less and less at Hartfield; which was not to be regretted.--The\n",
      "intimacy between her and Emma must sink; their friendship must change\n",
      "into a calmer sort of goodwill; and, fortunately, what ought to be,\n",
      "and must be, seemed already beginning, and in the most gradual, natural\n",
      "manner.\n",
      "\n",
      "Before the end of September, Emma attended Harriet to church, and saw\n",
      "her hand bestowed on Robert Martin with so complete a satisfaction, as\n",
      "no remembrances, even connected with Mr. Elton as he stood before them,\n",
      "could impair.--Perhaps, indeed, at that time she scarcely saw Mr. Elton,\n",
      "but as the clergyman whose blessing at the altar might next fall on\n",
      "herself.--Robert Martin and Harriet Smith, the latest couple engaged of\n",
      "the three, were the first to be married.\n",
      "\n",
      "Jane Fairfax had already quitted Highbury, and was restored to the\n",
      "comforts of her beloved home with the Campbells.--The Mr. Churchills\n",
      "were also in town; and they were only waiting for November.\n",
      "\n",
      "The intermediate month was the one fixed on, as far as they dared, by\n",
      "Emma and Mr. Knightley.--They had determined that their marriage ought\n",
      "to be concluded while John and Isabella were still at Hartfield, to\n",
      "allow them the fortnight's absence in a tour to the seaside, which was\n",
      "the plan.--John and Isabella, and every other friend, were agreed in\n",
      "approving it. But Mr. Woodhouse--how was Mr. Woodhouse to be induced\n",
      "to consent?--he, who had never yet alluded to their marriage but as a\n",
      "distant event.\n",
      "\n",
      "When first sounded on the subject, he was so miserable, that they were\n",
      "almost hopeless.--A second allusion, indeed, gave less pain.--He\n",
      "began to think it was to be, and that he could not prevent it--a very\n",
      "promising step of the mind on its way to resignation. Still, however, he\n",
      "was not happy. Nay, he appeared so much otherwise, that his daughter's\n",
      "courage failed. She could not bear to see him suffering, to know\n",
      "him fancying himself neglected; and though her understanding almost\n",
      "acquiesced in the assurance of both the Mr. Knightleys, that when\n",
      "once the event were over, his distress would be soon over too, she\n",
      "hesitated--she could not proceed.\n",
      "\n",
      "In this state of suspense they were befriended, not by any sudden\n",
      "illumination of Mr. Woodhouse's mind, or any wonderful change of his\n",
      "nervous system, but by the operation of the same system in another\n",
      "way.--Mrs. Weston's poultry-house was robbed one night of all her\n",
      "turkeys--evidently by the ingenuity of man. Other poultry-yards in\n",
      "the neighbourhood also suffered.--Pilfering was _housebreaking_ to Mr.\n",
      "Woodhouse's fears.--He was very uneasy; and but for the sense of his\n",
      "son-in-law's protection, would have been under wretched alarm every\n",
      "night of his life. The strength, resolution, and presence of mind of the\n",
      "Mr. Knightleys, commanded his fullest dependence. While either of them\n",
      "protected him and his, Hartfield was safe.--But Mr. John Knightley must\n",
      "be in London again by the end of the first week in November.\n",
      "\n",
      "The result of this distress was, that, with a much more voluntary,\n",
      "cheerful consent than his daughter had ever presumed to hope for at the\n",
      "moment, she was able to fix her wedding-day--and Mr. Elton was called\n",
      "on, within a month from the marriage of Mr. and Mrs. Robert Martin, to\n",
      "join the hands of Mr. Knightley and Miss Woodhouse.\n",
      "\n",
      "The wedding was very much like other weddings, where the parties have\n",
      "no taste for finery or parade; and Mrs. Elton, from the particulars\n",
      "detailed by her husband, thought it all extremely shabby, and very\n",
      "inferior to her own.--“Very little white satin, very few lace veils; a\n",
      "most pitiful business!--Selina would stare when she heard of it.”--But,\n",
      "in spite of these deficiencies, the wishes, the hopes, the confidence,\n",
      "the predictions of the small band of true friends who witnessed the\n",
      "ceremony, were fully answered in the perfect happiness of the union.\n",
